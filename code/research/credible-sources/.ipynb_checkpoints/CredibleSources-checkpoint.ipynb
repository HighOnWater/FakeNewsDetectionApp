He made seven 3-pointers to become the ninth player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career 3s.\\n\\nClint Capela added 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Chris Paul had 22 points. Houston has won four of five.\\n\\nBogdan Bogdanovic had 24 points for the Kings. They have lost two straight and fell to 0-3 against Houston this season.\\n\\n76ERS 118, TIMBERWOLVES 109\\n\\nMINNEAPOLIS -- Tobias Harris scored 25 points for Philadelphia in Jimmy Butler's jeer-filled return to Minnesota, helping the 76ers hang on and move one step closer toward solidifying the No. 3 seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs.\\n\\nHouston Rockets guard James Harden (13) grabs a rebound from Sacramento Kings forward Marvin Bagley III during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Saturday, March 30, 2019, in Houston. Houston won the game, 119-108. (Eric Christian Smith/Associated Press)\\n\\nBen Simmons pitched in 20 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Sixers (49-27), who stretched their lead over Boston and Indiana to 4½ games with eight games to go. They're still four games behind second-place Toronto.\\n\\nRookie Jonah Bolden filled in for Joel Embiid and posted a career-best 19 points for the Sixers, who overcame the precautionary absence of their All-Star center and a quiet night by Butler (12 points on 4-for-17 shooting with 13 rebounds and five assists) to start a three-game road trip with a quality win.\\n\\nNETS 110, CELTICS 96\\n\\nNEW YORK -- D'Angelo Russell scored 20 of his 29 points in another blistering third quarter against Boston, leading Brooklyn over the short-handed Celtics.\\n\\nBack from a seven-game trip that lasted more than two weeks, the Nets had a happy homecoming thanks largely to Russell, who added 10 assists and finished with 25 points after halftime.\\n\\nCaris LeVert added 15 points for the Nets, who had dropped the final two games of the trip and still face a tough stretch now that they're back home.\\n\\nGordon Hayward scored 19 points for the Celtics, who rested Kyrie Irving and Al Horford on the second night of back-to-back games after a big victory over Indiana a night earlier.\\n\\nPISTONS 99, TRAIL BLAZERS 90\\n\\nDETROIT -- Reggie Jackson scored 28 points, Andre Drummond had 22 points and 19 rebounds, and Detroit ended Portland's six-game winning streak.\\n\\nThe Pistons were missing Blake Griffin, who was scratched moments before game time with a sore left knee, but were able to maintain a half-game lead over the Brooklyn Nets for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. Detroit has won 11 straight at home.\\n\\nDamian Lillard scored 23 points and Enes Kanter added 20 points and 15 rebounds for Portland, which fell a half-game behind the Houston Rockets for the third seed in the Western Conference.\\n\\nMAGIC 121, PACERS 116\\n\\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Aaron Gordon had 23 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, and Orlando racked up a season-high 37 assists in a win over Indiana to keep pace in the Eastern Conference playoff race.\\n\\nComing off a blowout loss at Detroit that snapped a six-game win streak, Orlando got back on track with a relentless attack. The Magic shot 51 percent from the field and finished with only seven turnovers.\\n\\nOrlando remained a half-game behind Miami for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot after the Heat beat the New York Knicks.\\n\\nDarren Collison posted 24 points and nine assists for the Pacers, who shot 53 percent from the field but committed 15 turnovers in losing to the Magic for the third time this season.\\n\\nHEAT 100, KNICKS 92\\n\\nNEW YORK -- Dion Waiters scored 28 points, Dwyane Wade added 16 in his last game at Madison Square Garden, and Miami beat New York.\\n\\nHassan Whiteside finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Heat, while Kelly Olynyk chipped in 12 points and 11 rebounds. Goran Dragic had 10 points and 10 assists.\\n\\nThe Heat have won six of their last eight games and hold a half-game lead over Orlando for the eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference.\\n\\nEmmanuel Mudiay scored 24 points for the Knicks, who have lost six straight and 14 of 15.\\n\\nRAPTORS 124, BULLS 101\\n\\nCHICAGO -- Serge Ibaka had 23 points and 12 rebounds, Fred VanVleet also scored 23 and Toronto routed Chicago despite playing without Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam.\\n\\nMarc Gasol had 17 points, eight rebounds and six assists as Toronto won its third straight.\\n\\nLeonard was excused for personal reasons and didn't make the trip to Chicago. He leads the Raptors in scoring at 27 points and has played in 55 of the team's 77 games this season. Siakam, who averages 17 points, was healthy and in uniform on the bench, but was held out to rest. The third-year forward had 31 points Thursday in a win over the New York Knicks.\\n\\nWalt Lemon Jr., in his first game with the team, led the short-handed Bulls with 19 points.\\n\\nGRIZZLIES 120, SUNS 115\\n\\nPHOENIX -- Jonas Valanciunas scored a career-high 34 points and grabbed 20 rebounds, Mike Conley added 33 points and Memphis overcame 48 from Devin Booker to beat Phoenix.\\n\\nValanciunas scored 10 points in the final 4 1/2 minutes as the Grizzlies finished on a 16-9 run. They had lost five of seven.\\n\\nBooker had 24 points in the first quarter and fell two short of becoming the fifth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points in three straight games. He had the ball on the final two Suns possessions but was double-teamed and could not get off a shot.\\n\\nCLIPPERS 132, CAVALIERS 108\\n\\nLOS ANGELES -- Montrezl Harrell scored 23 points, rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 22 points and eight assists, and playoff-bound Los Angeles beat Cleveland.\\n\\nThe Clippers have won seven of eight and 12 of 14, and they moved within one-half game of San Antonio for the fifth seed in the Western Conference.\\n\\nJaMychal Green added 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who connected on 15 of 33 3-pointers. Los Angeles shot 62.4 percent overall.\\n\\nJordan Clarkson scored 26 points in 24 minutes off the bench for Cleveland, while rookie Collin Sexton added 21 points and Cedi Osman had 19. Sexton scored at least 20 points for the 11th time in his past 12 games.\\n\\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

       "   'body': \"LUCKNOW: Eastern UP, the region that will play a key role in the numbers game for the next Lok Sabha, will see a triangular contest as Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh Yadav and Priyanka Gandhi slug it out.\\n\\nFor Akhilesh, who is contesting from Azamgarh, it's a maiden foray into the region, which accounts for 35 Lok Sabha seats. BJP dominated the region in both the 2014 Lok Sabha election and the 2017 assembly polls. In 2014, it won 32 of the 35 Lok Sabha seats here.\\n\\nAkhilesh's father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had won Azamgarh by 60,000 votes against BJP's Ramakant Yadav in 2014, when BJP had swept the region riding the Modi wave. BJP is yet to announce its nominee, but speculation is rife that Bhojpuri film star Dinesh Lal Yadav aka Nirahua, who joined BJP on Thursday, may take on the SP chief.\\n\\nAzamgarh has a large Yadav and Muslim population, so the caste arithmetic favours Akhilesh. Nirahua is from neighbouring Ghazipur and BJP hopes to exploit his star power among Bhojpuri speaking population.\\n\\nEastern UP comprises the most densely populated areas and has been historically crippled by poverty and backwardness. Human development indicators of the region have been worse than even drought-prone Bundelkhand.\\n\\nOut of 21 CMs since Independence, including Yogi, nine belonged to this region, yet it lags in employment, industrial development, infrastructure, investment and agriculture. Under Yogi, state machinery has shifted focus to the eastern region but it is yet to show tangible impact.\\n\\nAfter the decline of Congress in the late 1980s, BJP gradually captured eastern UP, drawing strength from the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and three seats of religious power - Ram temple in Ayodhya, Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur, which is Yogi's home ground, and Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi. But the rise of SP and BSP after their 1993 alliance dealt a blow to saffron power.\\n\\nThe regional allies dominated the region for more than a decade when BJP was reduced to 10 seats in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha polls. However, in 2014, BJP turned the caste mathematics upside down, winning a large chunk of OBCs from SP and non-Jatav Dalits from BSP.\\n\\nThe onus, therefore, is on Akhilesh to revive the alliance. By tying up with BSP and snatching away Yogi's bastion Gorakhpur in a bypoll, he showed it's possible. In eastern UP, he has entered alliances with smaller outfits, such as Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) Party. The latter comprises primarily Mallahs (boatmen community), who wield considerable influence in Gorakhpur, Bhadohi and neighbouring areas. In the Gorakhpur bypoll, SP loaned its candidate from Nishad - Praveen Nishad, who won. He is likely to be re-nominated.\\n\\nBJP is banking on Modi and Yogi and their development plank in Varanasi and Gorakhpur. Since 2014, Modi has rolled out development projects to the tune of Rs 2 lakh crore in Varanasi. Yogi, after becoming CM, has followed Modi's development model in Gorakhpur.\\n\\nCongress has had a late start. After its attempts to join the grand alliance failed, Rahul Gandhi deployed his sister Priyanka with the objective of reviving the party in east UP. Her Ganga yatra from Allahabad to Varanasihas enthused the cadre and filled a leadership vacuum. But the Congress vote can cut both ways. If it win over Muslims, it will dent SP-BSP. If upper castes gravitate towards it, BJP will be in trouble.\",\n",

       "   'body': 'The scoreboard at Shea Stadium showed no hits for Chicago as Tom Seaver pitched to Ernie Banks on of the Cubs on July 9. Seaver came within two outs of a perfect game.CreditCreditAssociated Press\\n\\nThe season began with a loss to the brand-new Montreal Expos, the Mets\\' eighth straight opening-day defeat. And the situation grew only worse. At the end of April, the Mets were 9-11. On May 27, they were 18-23, in fourth place in the National League East. Off in the distance were the first-place Chicago Cubs.\\n\\nBut the next day, the Mets beat San Diego, 1-0, in a game in which Jerry Koosman struck out 15 batters. That began an 11-game winning streak that left the Mets -- yeah, the Mets -- with a record of 29-23.\\n\\nThe revolution was on. In early July, the Mets had their first showdown with the Cubs, and Tom Seaver came within two outs of a perfect game. A week later, the Mets took two out of three at Wrigley Field. The Mets were now in second place, just four games out of first.\\n\\nAt which point, the Mets flattened out. On July 30, Manager Gil Hodges even went out to left field to pull Cleon Jones from the game. Jones, he felt, was not hustling.\\n\\nHodges was sending a message, but the Mets kept struggling. By mid-August, they were 10 games out.\\n\\nAnd then, with Woodstock being staged in the background, the Mets took off. They swept the Padres at Shea in two weekend doubleheaders and began a run in which they would win 38 of their last 49 games of the season, sometimes in stupefying fashion.\\n\\nThere was, for instance, the delirious Aug. 30 game in San Francisco in which the Mets threw out runners at home in the eighth and ninth innings along with another runner at third and then won in the 10th on a home run.\\n\\nA week later, Manager Leo Durocher and his swooning Cubs arrived at Shea, and the Mets beat them twice, with fans sarcastically serenading Durocher and with a black cat running in front of the Chicago dugout. The next day, the Mets moved into first. Two days later, they won a 1-0, 1-0 doubleheader in Pittsburgh. The starting pitchers drove in both runs.\\n\\nThree days later, the Mets struck out a record 19 times against Steve Carlton in St. Louis. But so what? They won, anyway, with Ron Swoboda hitting two two-run homers.\\n\\nThe Mets were now pulling away with 15 games to go. The impossible had become the inevitable.\\n\\nFollowing are excerpts from New York Times articles in 1969.\\n\\nSHEA STADIUM, JUNE 3\\n\\nMilestone for Mets: They\\'re 24-23\\n\\nScaling new heights again, the New York Mets climbed past the break-even point and into second place in the National League East by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2, at Shea Stadium tonight.\\n\\nTwo home runs by Ed Kranepool, a well-placed misplay by the Dodgers, Tom Seaver\\'s eighth pitching victory and Tug McGraw\\'s second save marked the historic occasion, which also stretched the current winning streak to six games.\\n\\nNo Met team had ever been above .500 beyond the fourth game of a season. In 1966, and again this year, the Mets won two of their first three games; but in 1966, they lost the next five and this year they lost the next four. Never again did they have more victories than defeats until now, when their record stands at 24-23. LEONARD KOPPETT\\n\\nJULY 8\\n\\nAnother Milestone: A Series That Matters\\n\\nIt has taken them 7½ years, 439 victories and 771 defeats, but today the Mets finally begin an important series.\\n\\nAt 2:05 p.m. at Shea Stadium, they start a three-game series with the Chicago Cubs, the only team ahead of them in the National League\\'s Eastern Division.\\n\\nThe bumbling players who opened at the Polo Grounds in 1962 and their masochistic fans would be dizzied by the Mets\\' five-game proximity to first place. And the New Yorkers have lost only three more games than the Cubs, the most important measurement between two winning clubs.\\n\\nWhether sold out or close to it, Shea should be rocking every minute of the series. The Cubs have lost three straight, the Mets have won five straight and Gil Hodges of the Mets and Leo Durocher of the Cubs have set up their best pitchers for the series. GEORGE VECSEY\\n\\nSHEA STADIUM, July 9\\n\\nSeaver Comes Within 2 Outs of Perfection\\n\\nTom Seaver of the Mets thrilled the biggest baseball crowd in Shea Stadium history tonight by coming within two outs of pitching a perfect game.\\n\\nJim Qualls, a rookie outfielder of the Chicago Cubs, drilled a solid single in the ninth that disappointed Seaver and the 59,083 fans who were quivering with every pitch.\\n\\nSeaver finished with a one-hitter and a 4-0 victory that narrowed the Cubs\\' division lead over the Mets to three games.\\n\\nThe Mets have won seven straight and the Cubs have lost five straight. And after the near-perfect game, who knows where these opposite kinds of momentum might lead?\\n\\nThe Mets were loose and confident going into the game because their best pitcher was going to work. The 24-year-old, right-handed Seaver, a fine athlete, had won 13 games and lost 3.\\n\\nBut two hours later, the Mets and their fans wanted much more than victory No. 14. They wanted perfection and the first no-hitter by a Met, and they cheered madly for every Cub out.\\n\\nThe first batter in the ninth was Randy Hundley, the experienced catcher. He tried to bunt a high pitch, but the ball rolled to Seaver\\'s right and Seaver threw Hundley out at first. The fans, ever sensitive, booed Hundley for having tried to bunt Seaver out of a perfect game.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old Qualls, a switch-hitter batting left-handed in his 18th major league game, was the next batter. Seaver wanted to keep the ball outside to him, but the pitch strayed a little too close to the plate and Qualls stroked it solidly to left-center, nowhere near Cleon Jones or Tommie Agee. GEORGE VECSEY\\n\\nJuly 16\\n\\nMoon or the Mets? In Bars, It\\'s the Latter\\n\\nThe moon didn\\'t figure in the conversation -- mostly in Spanish -- at the Full Moon Bar and Grill at 161st and Broadway. The bar was recently renamed La Luna Llena.\\n\\nIt\\'s owner, Richard Hauseman, was asked why the customers weren\\'t following the moon shot on television. \"What\\'s there?\" he retorted. \"Walter Cronkite talking -- that\\'s all.\"\\n\\nThe television sets were on at most other bars, but not for Walter Cronkite or the astronauts. In Chicago, the Mets were ahead of the Cubs, suggesting a miracle that even Jules Verne did not foresee. A bartender was asked whether his customers were more interested in the Mets or the astronauts.\\n\\n\"The Mets, of course,\" he said. \"Aren\\'t you?\" JOSEPH LELYVELD\\n\\nAug. 4\\n\\nThe Mets Lose Some of the Magic\\n\\nThe Mets have seen the moment of their greatness flicker, pressing Chicago for the Eastern Division lead before falling back. The fans overreacted, talking World Series, and the national press and broadcasting, who used to come to Shea Stadium to interview the other teams of the National League, trumpeted the emergence of a great new power. Then the Mets lost seven of 11, their first bona fide slump. They also suffered some of the emotional problems of sudden glory.\\n\\nLast Wednesday afternoon, Hodges pointedly removed Cleon Jones, his best player, from the outfield in the midst of a game, apparently for playing a ball too casually. And then Ron Swoboda, the Mets\\' best off-season banquet player, publicly chided the tra-la-la attitude of the club, the lack of intensity. ROBERT LIPSYTE\\n\\nSAN DIEGO, Aug. 27\\n\\n12 Wins in 13 Games as Mets Close on Cubs\\n\\nJerry Koosman pitched the New York Mets to within two games of first place tonight as he overpowered the San Diego Padres, 4-1, with a two-hitter for the Mets\\' sixth straight victory.\\n\\nHe allowed the two hits in the first inning but no more the rest of the game and he faced only 31 batters -- four more than the minimum.\\n\\nThe Mets continued past another milestone on their remarkable road several hours after the first-place Chicago Cubs had lost again to the Cincinnati Reds. And by the time the Mets had finished their work tonight, they were all even with Chicago in games lost, and the Cubs\\' lead in the Eastern Division rested solely on the fact that they had played -- and won -- four more times.\\n\\nThe victory was Koosman\\'s third in a row, and the Mets\\' 12th in their last 13 decisions, while the Cubs were dropping eight of 10. It also was No. 74 for the Mets this season, one more than the record total they achieved all of last season, and it was their 11th in a row over San Diego.\\n\\nThe situation at the top of the Eastern Division was growing so sticky that Ernie Banks even telephoned long-distance to San Diego tonight. JOSEPH DURSO\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 30\\n\\nWalking a High Wire, Mets Win in 10th\\n\\nThe New York Mets survived three hours of thrills -- and sometimes terror -- and defeated the San Francisco Giants, 3-2, on a 10th-inning home run by Donn Clendenon.\\n\\nThe victory ended the Giants\\' winning streak at nine games and kept the Mets 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs, who beat the Atlanta Braves, 5-4.\\n\\nClendenon put the finishing touches to the Mets\\' afternoon by hitting a 2-1 pitch from Gaylord Perry over the right-field fence with two outs. But he did it only after the Mets lived through two wild innings in the eighth and ninth, during which the Giants put five runners on base -- and the Mets threw two of them out at home plate and one at third base. JOSEPH DURSO\\n\\nSHEA STADIUM, Sept. 9\\n\\nSeaver Beats Cubs; Mets Get Closer\\n\\nThe New York Mets -- the urchins of baseball for the last seven years -- shook down the thunder from the sky tonight when they overpowered the Chicago Cubs, 7-1, before 58,436 persons in Shea Stadium.\\n\\nIt was the fourth straight victory for the Mets and the sixth straight defeat for the Cubs, and the urchins moved to within a half game of first place in the National League East with three weeks to go.\\n\\nThe Mets, who have never finished higher than ninth, made the tumultuous scene last night on the five-hit pitching of their prodigy, Tom Seaver. The 25-year-old Californian allowed four singles, one double and one walk, and achieved his 21st victory in the gaudiest season of pitching in Mets history.\\n\\nHe was never behind and rarely was in trouble. And the crowd -- which included 51,448 paying customers -- spent much of the game on its feet, waving handkerchiefs and serenading Manager Leo Durocher of Chicago with stanzas of \"Goodbye, eo.\"\\n\\nLeo might have felt like going, too. JOSEPH DURSO\\n\\nSHEA STADIUM, Sept. 10\\n\\nNew Chant at Shea: \\'We\\'re No. 1\\'\\n\\nStop the season!\\n\\nThe New York Mets reached and held first place tonight by sweeping a doubleheader from the Montreal Expos, 3-2 in 12 innings, and 7-1, and it is rank disregard for poetic justice to make them risk this precious attainment through the 21 games that still remain on the schedule.\\n\\nNevertheless, the ultimate height has been scaled, after seven humiliating years only partially soothed by laughter, and never again can it be said that the Mets have never been on top. \"We\\'re No. 1, we\\'re No. 1\" chanted the 23,512 in Shea Stadium tonight, and that moment can never be taken away from them or from Met supporters everywhere.\\n\\nThe moment, actually, was 10:13 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time.\\n\\nThis eminence, not even dreamt of for this year when the season began, has been achieved by a four-week hot streak, coinciding with Chicago\\'s first slump. JOSEPH DURSO\\n\\nPITTSBURGH, Sept. 12\\n\\n1-0, 1-0: Mets Win Tight Doubleheader\\n\\nThe galloping New York Mets continued their assault on the establishment of baseball tonight by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates twice by identical scores of 1-0 and running their winning streak to nine games.\\n\\nThey also added half a game to their lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League\\'s Eastern Division. The Cubs ended an eight-game losing streak tonight when they beat the St. Louis Cardinals, and they now trail the Mets by 2½ games with less than three weeks to go.\\n\\nThree pitchers limited the Pirates to eight hits and no runs in the doubleheader. In the opener, Jerry Koosman pitched a three-hitter and, in the second game, Don Cardwell allowed four hits for eight innings and Tug McGraw gave up one in the ninth.\\n\\nIn both games, the starting pitchers also batted themselves to victory -- Koosman with a single off Bob Moose in the fifth inning, and Cardwell with a single off Dock Ellis in the second inning.\\n\\nAs a result, the Mets added these features to their high-flying caps with only 18 games left: They won their 24th and 25th games of 31 played since Aug. 13, when they trailed the Chicago Cubs by 10 games; they won their 21st and 22nd shutouts of the season, and their third in a row, and they extended their recent string of shutout innings to 34. JOSEPH DURSO\\n\\nST. LOUIS, Sept. 15\\n\\nEven 19 Strikeouts Can\\'t Slow the Mets\\n\\nSteve Carlton of the St. Louis Cardinals set a major league record tonight by striking out 19 New York Mets. But the Mets still won the game, 4-3, on a pair of two-run home runs by Ron Swoboda and extended their lead to 4½ games with 15 to play.\\n\\nCarlton, a 24-year-old left-hander, struck out the side in four of the nine innings as he surpassed the record of 18 strikeouts set by Sandy Koufax, Bob Feller and Don Wilson. He even fanned Swoboda twice, on his first and third times at bat.\\n\\nBut on his second and fourth trips to the plate, the Maryland muscleman drove home runs into the left-field seats, both times with a man on base, both times with the Mets trailing by one run.\\n\\nAs a result, the Mets swung even higher on their high-flying trapeze with two and a half weeks to play.

       "   'title': \"Meet The College Coach Who Discovered Ja Morant, Murray State's All-American and Top NBA Prospect\",\n",
       "   'body': 'Five years ago, Trevor Deloach earned his first full-time assistant basketball coaching job at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a small Division 1 program without much of a winning tradition. The Hawks had finished above .500 once in the previous 33 seasons and had never played in the NCAA tournament.\\n\\nStill, Deloach was aggressive and eager to make his mark, so he scoured the East Coast for recruits. He was particularly plugged into the scene in South Carolina, his home state. He had grown up in Saluda, S.C., and played one season at the University of South Carolina before transferring.\\n\\nIn 2015, Deloach\\'s second season at Maryland Eastern Shore, he found out about a rising high school junior guard named Temetrius Morant, who most people called Ja. Morant had averaged 18 points per game as a sophomore but had not received any college scholarships. After seeing Morant play for his AAU team and at Crestwood High School in Sumter, S.C., Deloach convinced Maryland Eastern Shore to offer Morant a scholarship.\\n\\n\"He reminded me of myself,\" said Deloach, who is now an assistant at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La. \"I just thought he was a sleeper. I never thought he would be a pro like he is, but I knew he had the tools to be really good.\"\\n\\nNow, Ja Morant is a sophomore All-American at Murray State University and a household name, particularly in recent days when he became one of the top stories in the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament.\\n\\nDuring No. 12 seed Murray State\\'s first round victory over No. 5 Marquette on Thursday, Morant had 17 points, 16 assists and 11 rebounds, the first triple-double in the tournament since 2012. On Saturday, he scored 28 points and made 5 of 6 three-pointers, but the Racers lost, 90-62, to No. 4 seed Florida State, ending their season and, almost certainly, Morant\\'s college career.\\n\\nMorant, who averaged 24.4 points and 10.2 assists this season, is projected as the second or third selection in June\\'s NBA draft, which seemed impossible when he entered college in the fall of 2017. Although Maryland Eastern Shore offered him a scholarship in 2015, Morant wasn\\'t on any other Division 1 program\\'s radar for several more months.\\n\\n\"I think he felt like he was doubted,\" said Dwayne Edwards, who coached Morant at Crestwood.\\n\\nMurray State, in fact, stumbled upon Morant. James Kane, who was then a Murray State assistant, was watching another recruit at an event in South Carolina in July 2016 when he took a break to get some food and noticed Morant playing in a 3-on-3 game on another court. Until that point, Maryland Eastern Shore, South Carolina State and Duquesne were the only schools to offer Morant a scholarship. Murray State soon did the same. The next month, the University of South Carolina followed suit, as Morant put up some big numbers in tournaments.\\n\\nAround the same time, Deloach joined head coach Murray Garvin\\'s staff at South Carolina State, about an hour from Morant\\'s hometown of Dalzell, S.C. Deloach and Garvin stayed in touch with Morant, but they knew it was a long shot to sign him.\\n\\n\"He just played better and better,\" Garvin said. \"Sometimes schools at our level, you can watch kids play themselves off your board. He just eventually played himself out of our range. He was one of those kids you kind of wished would slip through the cracks, but he didn\\'t slip too far.\"\\n\\nMorant ended up committing to Murray State in September 2016, entering his senior year at Crestwood. The news didn\\'t surprise or disappoint Deloach. Murray State coach Matt McMahon had been an assistant at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington during the 2010-11 season, which was Deloach\\'s junior season at the school. Deloach was confident Morant had made the right choice.\\n\\n\"Once he got too big for me, I was just like, \\'That\\'s a great situation for him,\\'\" Deloach said. \"I just knew how Coach McMahon was with me. He lets his guys play, he pushes guys, he motivates his guys, he develops them.\"\\n\\nStill, even McMahon couldn\\'t have foreseen what was to come. Morant averaged 12.7 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game as a freshman last season. He then caught the attention of NBA scouts when he played well at Chris Paul\\'s Elite Guard Camp in Winston-Salem, N.C. in August. NBA personnel have continued to follow Morant closely this season, and the 6-foot-3, 175-pound guard has emerged as a sure-fire top-three pick in June\\'s draft. He has also become a celebrity of sorts.\\n\\nBefore Saturday\\'s game, iconic professional wrestler Ric Flair sent a message on Twitter wishing Murray State good luck against Florida State and referring to Morant as \"THE MAN In College Basketball!\" It wasn\\'t meant to be for the Racers, but they still exceeded expectations this season, finishing 28-5.\\n\\nMorant, who turns 20 in August, was better than anyone anticipated, too. He is the first Division 1 player to average 20 points and 10 assists in a season since the NCAA began tracking assists in 1983. His flashy game and memorable name are sure to continue to attract interest and more fans in the coming years. Deloach will be watching closely, as well, as Morant enters the NBA.\\n\\n\"I just feel like he\\'s gonna blossom,\" Deloach said. \"He can handle and pass the ball so well. That\\'ll keep him on the floor. Everything else is just gonna fall into place for him.\"',\n",

(Streeter Lecka/Getty Images) By Matt Bonesteel , Matt Bonesteel Reporter for the Early Lead Scott Allen and Scott Allen Reporter covering D.C. pro and local college sports Jacob Bogage Jacob Bogage National sports writer and blogger March 22 at 10:18 AM\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t much Madness on Thursday: The first full day of NCAA tournament games featured no buzzer beaters, virtually no dramatic endings, and only four wins by lower seeds. Let\\'s see if Friday offers a course correction.\\n\\nLatest updates | Schedule and results | Tournament news and notes\\n\\nFriday\\'s games of the day\\n\\n* No. 1 Virginia vs. No. 16 Gardner-Webb, approx. 3:10 p.m. Eastern, truTV: We\\'re only putting this here because it can\\'t happen again, right? RIGHT? The Runnin\\' Bulldogs currently rank 165th in Ken Pomeroy\\'s statistical rankings. UMBC\\'s rank last season: 166. Gulp.\\n\\n* No. 11 Arizona State vs. No. 6 Buffalo, approx. 4 p.m. Eastern, TNT: Sporting their highest-ever NCAA tournament seed, the Bulls get their shot at Sun Devils Coach Bobby Hurley, who put Buffalo on the college basketball map as its coach earlier this decade before leaving for Arizona State.\\n\\n* No. 9 UCF vs. No. 8 VCU, approx. 9:40 p.m. Eastern, CBS: The Knights have tall human Tacko Fall, who is 7 feet 6. The Rams might not have a fully healthy Marcus Evans, the team\\'s leader in scoring and assists who suffered a knee injury during the Atlantic 10 tournament.\\n\\nLatest updates\\n\\nThe most recent news and highlights from the 2019 men\\'s NCAA tournament.\\n\\nWade doubtful\\n\\nKansas State forward Dean Wade, an all-Big 12 first-team selection, is considered doubtful to play Friday against UC Irvine and for the rest of the tournament after a recurrence of a foot injury that sidelined him earlier this season. Wade, who averaged 12.9 points and a team-high 6.2 rebounds per game, also missed last season\\'s NCAA tournament with a broken foot, though the Wildcats still advanced to the Elite Eight.\\n\\nIzzo gets after one of his players\\n\\nOne of the more notable images from Thursday\\'s tournament openers was the sight of Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo yelling at Spartans freshman Aaron Henry to the point where he had to be restrained by guard Cassius Winston. And while the sight of Izzo getting heated on the sideline during a game hardly is unusual, the degree to which he tore into Henry certainly seemed to be. Izzo insisted he simply was being a coach.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with challenging a kid that makes some mistakes?\" he said after Michigan State outlasted Bradley, 76-65, per ESPN. \"Aaron Henry -- trust me -- did some things that you can\\'t do as a starter on a top 5 team at the end of your freshman year. They were effort-related.\\n\\n\"I did get after him. He did respond. He did make a couple of big buckets. He did make some big free throws but that\\'s not good enough. It\\'s one-and-done time. The \\'my-bads\\' are out the window.\"\\n\\nSaid Henry: \"I\\'ve heard worse from him. I\\'ve got it worse in practice before.\"\\n\\nA tragedy for Florida State\\n\\nFlorida State\\'s celebration of its 76-69 win over Vermont on Thursday was muted after senior forward Phil Cofer learned that his father had passed away immediately after the game. Mike Cofer, a former Pro Bowl linebacker with the Detroit Lions, suffered from a rare disease that affects organs and tissue, according to ESPN. Phil Cofer, who didn\\'t play Thursday because of a foot injury, received a phone call notifying him of his father\\'s death in the locker room following the game, breaking down in tears. He did not speak with reporters.\\n\\nFriday\\'s upset watch\\n\\n* No. 13 UC Irvine vs. No. 4 Kansas State, 2 p.m. Eastern, TBS: As noted, the Wildcats will be without one of their top players in Wade. The whimsically nicknamed Anteaters have held opponents to 40.6 percent shooting from two-point range, the best mark in the nation. UC Irvine also has a roster full of NBA pedigrees, including the sons of Caron Butler, Doc Rivers and Chris Welp. (Read more)\\n\\n* No. 12 Oregon vs. No. 5 Wisconsin, approx. 4:30 p.m. Eastern, TBS: 12-5 games usually don\\'t pit power-conference teams against each other, but the Pac-12 stunk this year so here we are. The Ducks are only here because they won their conference tournament, but their stingy defense could keep the Badgers in check.\\n\\n* No. 12 Liberty vs. No. 5 Mississippi State, 7:27 p.m. Eastern, truTV: The Flames are higher than a No. 16 seed for the first time, operate at one of the slowest paces in the nation and are exceptional shooters from both two-point range and the free throw line.\\n\\nSchedule and results\\n\\nGame times and TV information.

       "   'title': \"President's re-election pitch resonates in heartland of Ukraine's...\",\n",
       "   'body': 'LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - At a cemetery in western Ukraine, a tall, gray-haired man lights candles and kisses the gravestone of his 35-year-old brother Taras, whose death, he said, changed his mind about who should win this month\\'s presidential election.\\n\\nTaras, a medical volunteer, was killed in 2015 rescuing wounded soldiers near Debaltseve during the government\\'s five-year-old conflict in eastern Ukraine against Kremlin-backed rebels, his brother Ihor Konchevych said.\\n\\nHe died for a free and independent Ukraine, something their grandfathers could only dream of in the Soviet era, he said, and President Petro Poroshenko is the best candidate to keep it on that path, even though he has not ended the war as he promised.\\n\\n\"In 2014, I did not vote for him,\" said Ihor, a dermatologist whose teenage nephew and niece are now fatherless. \"Now (I will) for one reason: he is pro-Ukraine, Russia does not support him.\"\\n\\nSuch support could help Poroshenko, who has consistently trailed in opinion polls, scrape into the second round and potentially win a second term.\\n\\nIt suggests that at least in western Ukraine, where Poroshenko\\'s polling remains relatively robust, his opposition to Russia and championing of the army, the church and closer ties with Europe and the United States is getting through.\\n\\nIt also suggests some people are willing to swallow whatever disappointment they might feel about his failure to end the war, lift living standards or thoroughly tackle corruption, because they see him as better than the alternatives.\\n\\nAt stake in the election is the leadership of a country on the front line of the West\\'s confrontation with Russia, five years after the Maidan street protests ousted Poroshenko\\'s Russia-friendly predecessor Viktor Yanukovich and the Russian annexation of Crimea.\\n\\nIt is a country still fighting a conflict in the eastern Donbass region that has killed 13,000 people despite a notional ceasefire, a shrunken state propped up by Western aid and sanctions against Moscow.\\n\\nThe election has boiled down to a three-horse race between the confectionary magnate Poroshenko, comic actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, with Poroshenko second and Zelenskiy extending his lead thanks to his fresh face and strong anti-corruption message.\\n\\nIt is perhaps not surprising that Poroshenko\\'s pro-Western messages resonate in Lviv, a picturesque city of cobblestone streets and central European charm that was under the Austrian empire until the First World War and is geographically closer to European Union countries than to Kiev.\\n\\nThe region was a driving force behind successive revolutions, including the 2014 protests in Maidan: according to Reuters\\' calculations, around 50 of the more than 100 protesters killed during the Maidan protests were from the west, 19 of them from the Lviv region alone.\\n\\nThe city is heavily Ukrainian-speaking compared to the Russian-speaking eastern regions. A survey by pollster SOCIS suggests voters in the west care more about the war and less about, for example, rising utility tariffs than the average Ukrainian.\\n\\nThe brother of Lesya Senyk, a 51-year-old kindergarten director, was one of those killed on Maidan, a protest sparked by Yanukovich\\'s decision to renege on signing a political and trade agreement with the EU after pressure from Moscow.\\n\\nHer brother\\'s sacrifice, she said, means Ukraine has become a proper state with a stronger army and aspirations to join the European Union.\\n\\nSenyk did not vote for Poroshenko in 2014 but she will now. \"I do not know who else could have saved the state in those difficult times, after the Maidan and during the war,\" she said. \"Maybe he\\'s not perfect. But we are not saints.\"\\n\\nPoroshenko won an emphatic victory in the 2014 election but his popularity has fallen sharply.\\n\\nHe can boast success: he secured visa-free travel for Ukrainians to the EU. There have been reforms and the government has stayed in an International Monetary Fund bailout program: a reassurance to investors.\\n\\nPoroshenko successfully lobbied for Ukraine to establish a national Orthodox church, independent from Russia. While he did not win the war, he did not lose it, and ramped up defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product from 3 percent under Yanukovich. A Poroshenko win is the worst-case scenario for Russia, which is a plus in some voters\\' eyes.\\n\\nBut he has been forced to apologize for his pledge to win the war within weeks, and that is not enough for some.\\n\\nThe parents of 22-year-old Yuriy Holub, who was killed in eastern Ukraine in 2014, will not vote for him.\\n\\n\"He promised, promised,\" said Holub\\'s father Hryhoriy, who is blind. \"Why did you promise if you were not confident that you can fulfill your promise? If he were an honest man he would quit of his own accord.\"\\n\\nHis wife Hanna, who holds pictures of her son close to her face due to her own failing sight, also said Poroshenko had let them down. \"First he said everything would be over in two weeks ... But such heavy shelling happened and our child was killed,\" she said in a trembling voice. \"There is no trust now.\"\\n\\nTheir son is buried in Lviv\\'s 18th century Lychakiv cemetery, along with about 70 others killed in the east.\\n\\nNazar Paselsky lies buried in a grave near Holub. Paselsky was killed by shelling, aged 21, in the Luhansk region in August 2014. His mother Hanna and father Mykola adopted a boy after Nazar\\'s death. Photos of Nazar, his diploma and his bravery award are on display on top of their cabinet.\\n\\nHanna voted for Poroshenko last time \"because he promised that everything will be over in three days. I wanted my child to come back home alive.\" Now she does not trust any candidate to guarantee a future for her adopted one-year-old, but thinks she might end up voting for Poroshenko in the second round.\\n\\nTwelve years younger than Poroshenko, Zelenskiy has tapped into disillusionment about Ukraine\\'s progress since Maidan and the desire for new faces in politics.\\n\\nBut some people, like Hryhoriy Zhalovaga, whose son Anatoliy died on Maidan, said a strong army was what was needed, not an entertainer with no political experience. Quoting another student during a commemoration ceremony for Maidan victims at the school his son attended, he said: \"Those who will vote for Zelenskiy, what do they want, a country of clowns?\"\\n\\nLviv-based analyst Oleg Gryniv said such views mean Poroshenko will probably carry a majority in the western areas like Galicia, which contains Lviv, citing the example of Ukraine\\'s first post-Soviet President Leonid Kravchuk.\\n\\n\"When he traveled through the eastern regions, they asked him about the price of socks, whether gas prices would be lowered,\" he said. \"And when he arrived in Galicia, there was only one question - whether the state would be kept intact.\"',\n",
