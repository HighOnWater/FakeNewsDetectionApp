It's happening in homes or in doctors' offices, but it's striking all the same,\" Stillman said.\n\nFor instance, a 2003 heat wave in Europe killed more than 70,000 people across the continent, researchers said.\n\nTo get a comprehensive view of the effects of future heat waves on humans and wildlife, Stillman gathered information from over 140 scientific studies on the topic.\n\nAs carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat and raise the Earth's average temperature, the heat waves we are accustomed to will worsen and become more frequent.\n\nIn some more extreme projected scenarios, temperatures rivalling or exceeding those seen in Europe in 2003 could last as much as four times as long by the end of the 21st century, the researchers found.\n\n\"This suggests that (during some years), all summer long we will have heat that is more intense than what happened in 2003,\" Stillman said.\n\nThere are ways to cope with heat waves, but they won't be available for everyone, or for every species, the researchers said.\n\nA lack of available infrastructure may make migrating to cooler climates difficult for many vulnerable human communities and cause large-scale conflict, they said.\n\nDue to humanity's sprawling ecological footprint, many animals won't have a clear path to cooler climes unless natural space is specifically set aside for that purpose.\n\nHeat waves can also have more subtle effects on the bodies of animals, such as prompting increases in the amount of specialised proteins that protect other molecules from the warping effects of heat.\n\n\"If populations of wildlife are experiencing more near-lethal temperatures, you won't see mortality but you might see shifts in their physiology that show they're getting close to mortality,\" Stillman said.\n\nBy studying responses like these, scientists could potentially get an early warning signal before heat waves start to produce more dire consequences.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "body": "Heat wave because of climate change is slowly becoming a deadly force for humans and wildlife on Earth.\n\nAccording to the study published in the journal 'Physiology', summertime is quickly becoming a deadly season for life on Earth. The researchers gathered information from over 140 scientific studies on the topic to come to a proper conclusion.\n\nClimate change is often talked about in terms of averages - like the goal set by the Paris Agreement to limit the Earth's temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. What such numbers fail to convey is that climate change will not only increase the world's average temperature, it will also intensify extreme heat waves that even now are harming people and wildlife.\n\nHeat waves have already produced striking images of mass mortality in animals, from the bleached skeletons of corals across swaths of the Great Barrier Reef to the deaths of horses during Australian summers, and in 2003 a heat wave in Europe killed more than 70,000 people across the continent.\n\nThe researchers found that as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat and raise the Earth's average temperature, the heat waves we're accustomed to will worsen and become more frequent. In some more extreme projected scenarios, temperatures rivalling or exceeding those seen in Europe in 2003 could last as much as four times as long by the end of the 21st century.\n\n\"Heat waves can also have more subtle effects on the bodies of animals, such as prompting increases in the number of specialized proteins that protect other molecules from the warping effects of heat. If populations of wildlife are experiencing more near-lethal temperatures, you won't see mortality but you might see shifts in their physiology that show they're getting close to mortality,\" said Jonathon Stillman, one of the co-authors of the study.\n\nBy studying responses like these, scientists could potentially get an early warning signal before heat waves start to produce more dire consequences.\n\nThere are ways to cope with heat waves, but they won't be available for everyone, or for every species. A lack of available infrastructure may make migrating to cooler climates difficult for many vulnerable human communities and cause large-scale conflict. And thanks to humanity's sprawling ecological footprint, many animals won't have a clear path to cooler climates unless natural space is specifically set aside for that purpose.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "title": "NBA playoff picture, standings, magic numbers, matchups, projections: Nuggets tie Warriors for No. 1 seed; Thunder falling",
    "body": "Out East, the tightest race is for No. 4 between Boston and Indiana, and for the final three seeds\n\nRight about three weeks remain in the NBA regular season. Barring something unforeseen, the eight playoff teams in each conference appear to be pretty safe, but the seeds are up for grabs from top to bottom. What follows is everything you need to know about where things stand entering Tuesday, March 19th. Teams are listed in order of current seed, with the projected finishing seed below. This post will continue to update for the remainder of the season as we keep track right down to the wire.\n\nNOTE: Our SportsLine model, developed by predictive data engineer Stephen Oh, simulates the entire season 10,000 times to produce the most unbiased and precise projections imaginable.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE Fight for No. 1\n\nGolden State Warriors (No. 1 seed)\n\nThe Warriors, who have already clinched a playoff spot, lost to the Spurs on Monday night to fall into a tie for the No. 1 seed with the Nuggets, who beat Boston. Golden State currently holds the tiebreaker with Denver via a 2-1 head-to-head advantage. The teams still have one matchup remaining, and if Denver were to win, the tiebreaker would get really close as both teams are division leaders (the second tiebreaker) and have virtually identical conference records (the third tiebreaker). Our SportsLine projections still favor Golden State to win the No. 1 seed, largely because of the difficulty of Denver's finishing schedule.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: SixProjected seed: No. 1 SportsLine odds: 81 percent to get No. 1 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. ClippersRemaining games: 13 (seven home, six road)Strength of remaining schedule: .467 (seventh-easiest in league)Next three games: at Timberwolves, vs. Pacers, vs. Mavericks\n\nTiebreaker: Currently own tiebreaker 2-1 over Denver (one matchup left)Denver Nuggets (No. 2 seed)\n\nAs mentioned above, Denver, who has also clinched a playoff spot, beat Boston Monday night and is now tied with Golden State for the No. 1 seed. Golden State still owns the tiebreaker via their 2-1 head-to-head advantage, but the teams still have one game remaining. Golden State's schedule is much easier down the stretch.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: SixProjected seed: No. 2 SportsLine odds: 18 percent to get No. 1 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. JazzRemaining games: 13 (eight road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .533 (ninth-toughest in league)Next three games: at Wizards, at Knicks, at Pacers\n\nTiebreaker: Currently trail Warriors 2-1 head-to-head (one matchup left) Entering the home-court logjamHouston Rockets (No. 3 seed)\n\nThe Rockets have won 11 of their last 12 and look to be playing their best ball of the season at the perfect time. The race for No. 3 is big because it would mean avoiding the Warriors -- assuming they finish with the top seed -- until the conference finals. Our data model favors the Rockets to stay in that spot.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: ThreeProjected seed: No. 3 SportsLine odds: 53 percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. ThunderRemaining games: 12 (seven road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .479 (13th-easiest in league)Next three games: at Hawks, at Grizzlies, vs. Spurs\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over GS, already lost tiebreaker to both OKC and PortlandPortland Trail Blazers (No. 4 seed)\n\nThe Blazers have won four of five as they inch closer to securing a top-four seed, though that is far from finished with the Spurs, Thunder and Jazz all within two games of Portland in the loss column. Home-court is nice, but again, assuming Golden State is able to secure the No. 1 seed, getting to the No. 3 seed would be huge for Portland. That would allow the Blazers to avoid the Warriors and potentially the Rockets through the first two rounds.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: FourProjected seed: No. 4SportsLine odds: 61.8 percent top-four seed, 26.8 percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. SpursRemaining games: 12 (eight road, seven home)Strength of remaining schedule: .474 (11th-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Mavericks, vs. Pistons, vs. Nets\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Houston; already lost tiebreaker to OKC; currently own tiebreaker over Jazz via division record; currently losing tiebreaker to Spurs via conference recordSan Antonio Spurs (No. 5 seed)\n\nThe Spurs, after a big win over Golden State Monday night, are currently the No. 5 seed, but you'll see our SportsLine projections have them finishing as the No. 6 seed behind Utah. That's largely because Utah owns the tiebreaker over San Antonio.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: FiveProjected seed: No. 6SportsLine odds: 6.1 percent to get top-four seedCurrent first-round matchup: at BlazersRemaining games: 11 (six road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .455 (fourth-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Heat, at Rockets, at Celtics\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Thunder via 2-1 head to head; currently own tiebreaker over Clippers via conference record; currently own tiebreaker over Blazers via conference record; already lost tiebreaker to JazzOklahoma City Thunder (No. 6 seed)\n\nThe Thunder have fallen from the No. 3 seed to the No. 6 seed, and our SportsLine projections have them falling even farther by season's end thanks to the league's fourth-toughest remaining schedule. The good news is OKC's remaining schedule is home-heavy and they own the tiebreaker over Houston, Portland and Utah.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: FiveProjected seed: No. 7SportsLine odds: 13.6 percent to get top-four seed, four percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: at RocketsRemaining games: 11 (seven home, four road)Strength of remaining schedule: .573 (fourth-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Raptors, at Raptors, at Grizzlies\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Houston, Portland and Utah; already lost tiebreaker to SpursUtah Jazz (No. 7 seed)\n\nThe Jazz, winners of four straight, have gone from a four-percent chance to earn a top-four seed to better than a 32-percent chance. Despite having the league's softest remaining schedule, our SportsLine projections don't have Utah quite cracking the top-four, but they do have them jumping from their current No. 7 seed to the No. 5 spot by season's end.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: SixProjected seed: No. 5SportsLine odds: 32.3 percent to get top-four seed, seven percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: at NuggetsRemaining games: 12 (six home, six road)Strength of remaining schedule: .398 (easiest in league)Next three games: at Knicks, at Hawks, at Bulls\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Spurs and Clippers; lost tiebreaker to OKC; currently losing tiebreaker with Houston (division leader)Los Angeles Clippers (No. 8 seed)\n\nThe Clippers are pretty safely in the playoffs because the Kings, at No. 9, have all but fallen out of the race. Entering Tuesday, the Clippers have a five-game lead in the loss column over Sacramento, which is effectively a six-game lead because the Clippers own the tiebreaker.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: SixProjected seed: No. 8SportsLine odds: 99.8 percent to make playoffsCurrent first-round matchup: at WarriorsRemaining games: 11 (six road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .477 (12th-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Pacers, at Cavaliers, at Knicks\n\nTiebreaker: Already lost tiebreaker to Jazz, currently losing tiebreaker to Spurs via conference record EASTERN CONFERENCE Fighting for No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks (No. 1 seed)\n\nThe Bucks have clinched a playoff spot and are now aiming for the No. 1 seed both in the East and overall. It's looking pretty good. The Bucks lead the No. 2 Raptors by three games in the loss column and also own the tiebreaker.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: TwoProjected seed: No. 1SportsLine odds: 95 percent to get No. 1 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. HeatRemaining games: 12 (eight home, four road)Strength of remaining schedule: .462 (sixth-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Lakers, at Cavaliers, vs. Heat\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over RaptorsToronto Raptors (No. 2 seed)\n\nThe Raptors have the second-easiest schedule coming down the stretch but they're just too far back of the Bucks to have a very realistic chance to catching them for the No. 1 seed. Interestingly, if somehow Indiana finishes as the No. 3 seed, the Raptors would actually benefit from being No. 2 as it would mean avoiding Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Boston through the first two rounds. If the Pacers stay at No. 4, where they are now, that scenario becomes moot and Toronto would face Philly in the second round if current seeds hold.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: FourProjected seed: No. 2SportsLine odds: Four percent to get No. 1 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. NetsRemaining games: 11 (six road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .431 (second-easiest in league)Next three games: at Thunder, vs. Thunder, vs. Hornets\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Sixers, already lost tiebreaker to Bucks Fighting for Home-Court Advantage Philadelphia 76ers (No. 3 seed)\n\nThe Sixers have clinched a playoff spot but have a ways to go to secure a top-four spot. Their upcoming game vs. Boston will be big, a win would get them a lot closer to sealing a top-four spot as right now Boston's hope of catching Philly rests on the Celtics' owning of the tiebreaker. Philly has already lost that, but distancing themselves further makes that tiebreaker less valuable. Philly has a favorable schedule down the stretch, though it's road-heavy.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: NineProjected seed: No. 3SportsLine odds: 81 percent to get No. 3 seed, 96.7 percent to get top-four seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. PistonsRemaining games: 12 (eight road, four home)Strength of remaining schedule: .444 (third-easiest in league)Next three games: at Hornets, vs. Celtics, at Hawks\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Pacers; already lost tiebreaker to Bucks, Raptors and CelticsIndiana Pacers (No. 4 seed)\n\nThe Pacers have clinched a playoff spot and are currently sitting in the No. 4 spot. Our SportsLine projections like them to hold off the Celtics and stay there, but it's slim. Entering Tuesday, Indiana leads Boston by just one game in the loss column and they have two head-to-head matchups remaining. Those games will very likely determine the No. 4 seed, and thus, home-court advantage in a 4-5 playoff series between these two.\n\nMagic Number to clinch top-four seed: 10Projected seed: No. 4SportsLine odds: 66.3 percent to get top-four seed; 8 percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: vs. CelticsRemaining games: 11 (six road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .552 (seventh-toughest in league)Next three games: at Clippers, at Warriors, vs. Nuggets\n\nTiebreaker: Already lost tiebreaker to Sixers, season series with Boston tied 1-1 with two to playBoston Celtics (No. 5 seed)\n\nAs mentioned above, Boston trails Indiana by one in the loss column entering Tuesday, and they still play each other two more times. At this point in the season, that one game lead is enough to make Boston, despite having an easier overall remaining schedule, the underdog to catch Indiana. That said, they control their own destiny. Win their final two games against the Pacers and they will very likely get that No. 4 seed.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: OneProjected seed: No. 5 SportsLine odds: 37 percent to get top-four seed; 10 percent to get No. 3 seedCurrent first-round matchup: at PacersRemaining games: 11 (seven road, four home)Strength of remaining schedule: .503 (14th-toughest in league)Next three games: at 76ers, at Hornets, vs. Spurs\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Sixers, season series with Indiana tied 1-1 with two to play Rounding Out the Field Detroit Pistons (No. 6 seed)\n\nThe Pistons have a two-game lead in the loss column over both Brooklyn and Miami. Brooklyn's schedule is brutal and Miami has played two fewer games. The Pistons don't own the tiebreaker against either of those teams, but the two-game lead is enough for our projection model to keep them in the No. 6 seed.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: EightProjected seed: No. 6SportsLine Projection: 97.8 percent to make playoffsCurrent first-round matchup: at SixersRemaining games: 12 (seven road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .513 (12th-toughest in league)Next three games: at Suns, at Trail Blazers, at Warriors\n\nTiebreaker: Currently losing tiebreaker to Miami via Heat being a division leader, already lost tiebreaker to NetsBrooklyn Nets (No. 7 seed)\n\nThe Nets are currently the No. 7 seed and our SportsLine projections have them falling to No. 8 by season's end. Brooklyn's closing schedule is murder. The Nets aren't assured of a playoff spot with just a two-game lead in the loss column over No. 9 Orlando going into play Tuesday night. The good news is the Nets do own the tiebreaker, so that lead is effectively three games.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: EightProjected seed: No. 8SportsLine odds: 78.8 percent to make playoffsCurrent first-round matchup: at RaptorsRemaining games: 10 (six road, four home)Strength of remaining schedule: .610 (toughest in league)Next three games: at Kings, at Lakers, at Blazers\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Pistons and Magic, trail season series vs. Miami 2-1 with one to playMiami Heat (No. 8 seed)\n\nThe Heat are currently the East's last team in at No. 8, but projections have them jumping Brooklyn for the No. 7 seed by season's end. They're a good bet to hold off Orlando for a playoff spot, but that will change if the Magic win their remaining game vs. Miami on March 26th.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 10Projected seed: No. 7SportsLine odds: 75 percent to make playoffsCurrent first-round matchup: at BucksRemaining games: 12 (eight road, four home)Strength of remaining schedule: .528 (10th-toughest in league)Next three games: at Spurs, at Bucks, at Wizards\n\nTiebreaker: Currently own tiebreaker over Detroit and Brooklyn, currently trail Orlando 2-1 in season series Outside Looking In Orlando Magic (No. 9 seed)\n\nOrlando is two games back in the loss column of the final playoff spot entering Tuesday. Projections suggest they have the best chance of catching Brooklyn, but they also have a head-to-head matchup with Miami remaining that could go a long way.\n\nProjected seed: No. 9SportsLine odds: 40.7 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 11 (six road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .489 (14th-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Pelicans, vs. Grizzlies, vs. Sixers\n\nTiebreaker: Currently leads Miami 2-1 in season series; already lost tiebreaker to Nets",

    "title": "Dragic, Wade lead Heat past Westbrook-less Thunder, 116-107",
    "body": "By Murray Evans\u2009|\u2009AP March 18 at 10:48 PM\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- Goran Dragic had 26 points and 11 assists, Dwyane Wade added 25 points and the Miami Heat took advantage of Russell Westbrook's absence to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 116-107 on Monday night.\n\nKelly Olynyk added 18 points and nine rebounds for Miami, which entered the game in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. The Heat snapped a six-game losing streak against Oklahoma City, which now has lost nine of its last 13 games to fall to sixth in the Western Conference.\n\nPaul George scored 31 points with nine rebounds and Jerami Grant had 27 points and 10 rebounds for Oklahoma City. Dennis Schroder, who started in Westbrook's place, scored 20 points. Steven Adams had 10 points and 12 rebounds but was limited by foul trouble to 25 minutes.\n\nWestbrook picked up his NBA-leading 16th technical foul in a loss to Golden State on Saturday, earning himself an automatic one-game suspension at a pivotal time for his team. He was not with the team on Monday and thus not inside Chesapeake Energy Arena to watch the Thunder struggle, shooting 43.7 percent and committing 19 turnovers.\n\nWithout Schroder running the second unit, Oklahoma City's bench lacked scoring punch and it showed, as Miami's reserves outscored the Thunder's 67-10. Dragic and Wade both came off the bench for the Heat, and reserve James Johnson had 14 points.\n\nThe first half featured wild swings. The Thunder led 13-0 after the Heat missed their first eight shots, but a 17-0 run by Miami's reserves put the Heat ahead before the end of the first quarter. The Heat led 41-29 with 8:12 left in the second quarter, but Oklahoma City pulled within 58-55 by halftime.\n\nMiami rebuilt its lead to 15 points in the third quarter. A dunk by Grant with 11:02 left got the Thunder within 86-79 before a 15-3 run by the Heat ended all doubt. A 3-pointer by Josh Richardson -- who is from the Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond -- put Miami up 101-82 with 7:29 left.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHeat: Justise Winslow missed his second straight game with a right thigh bruise suffered Friday against Milwaukee, while Rodney McGruder sat out with left knee soreness. ... Former Thunder player Dion Waiters received louder-than-usual applause as starting lineups were introduced, but Wade received a standing ovation when he entered four minutes into the game. ... Wade's 674 career points vs. the Thunder is his second-highest total against a Western Conference foe, behind only Portland (699).\n\nThunder: Westbrook could earn another one-game suspension for every two technical fouls the rest of the regular season. He's now missed nine games this season because of injury or suspension. ... Backup C Nerlens Noel didn't play because of a left quad contusion. ... Markieff Morris picked up a technical foul with 1:40 left in the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHeat: Continue their four-game trip on Wednesday in San Antonio.\n\nThunder: Host Toronto on Wednesday before visiting the Raptors on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

    "body": "Goran Dragic scored 26 points off the bench to lead the visiting Miami Heat to a 116-107 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road Monday night.\n\nThe Heat's reserves were plenty productive, not only with Dragic hitting six 3-pointers but with Dwyane Wade scoring 25 in his final game at Oklahoma City.\n\nWade helped the Heat win the 2012 NBA Finals over the Thunder.\n\nJames Johnson also added 14 off the bench as Miami's reserves outscored Oklahoma City's 67-10. Dragic also added 11 assists. Kelly Olynyk had 18 points and nine rebounds to help Miami win for the seventh time in nine games.\n\nOklahoma City was playing without Russell Westbrook, who was suspended after picking up his 16th technical foul of the season in a Saturday loss to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nPaul George led the Thunder with 31 points, and he grabbed nine rebounds. Jeremi Grant added a career-high 27 points and 10 boards, Dennis Schroder scored 20 points, and Steven Adams had 10 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nThe Thunder didn't appear to miss Westbrook much early as they scored the game's first 13 points.\n\nSchroder, starting in Westbrook's spot, had four assists in the first 5:17 of the game.\n\nBut when Schroder left the floor, things quickly crumbled for Oklahoma City, and they could never quite recover. Schroder had only two more assists.\n\nMiami missed its first eight shots before hitting seven of its next nine to kick-start a 17-2 run that put the Heat up front by the time the first quarter was over. The Heat led by 12 early in the second quarter.\n\nThe Thunder lost for the third consecutive game and for the ninth time in their past 13.\n\nOklahoma City turned the ball over 19 times.\n\nIn addition to playing without Westbrook, the Thunder were also without Nerlens Noel, who was a late scratch because of a thigh injury.\n\nNoel's absence was magnified when Adams picked up his fifth foul less than three minutes into the second half.\n\nThe Heat were without Justise Winslow and Rodney McGruder. McGruder was sidelined due to a sore left knee, and Winslow missed his second consecutive game with a right thigh bruise.",

    "title": "NBA Power Rankings: Guess who's back?",
    "body": "The Golden State Warriors bounced back from a loss to the Phoenix Suns with road wins over the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder to regain the top spot from the Milwaukee Bucks, who will now be without 2017 Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon until the playoffs.\n\nOur panel (ESPN's Tim MacMahon and Andre' Snellings, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) is ranking all 30 teams from top to bottom, taking stock of which are playing the best basketball and which are looking most like title contenders.\n\nThe only thing that has stopped center DeMarcus Cousins of late is his sore right foot that will merit an MRI on Monday in San Antonio. Cousins is averaging 16.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists in March and scored a season-high 27 against the Rockets on March 13. The Warriors are bringing in some insurance at center with the return of Andrew Bogut, who is expected to join the team tonight in San Antonio. -- Spears\n\n2. Milwaukee Bucks\n\nRecord: 52-18\n\nThe Bucks, who thus far have had a dream season in piecing together the league's best record, got their worst news of the season over the weekend: Starter Malcolm Brogdon will miss the next six to eight weeks with a plantar fascia tear in his right foot. Aside from the second-year guard's complete skill set, which is hard to replace, his absence could throw off the team's cohesion. The Brogdon-Bledsoe-Middleton-Antetokounmpo-Lopez lineup has appeared in more games together (56) than any other five-man group in the NBA this season. -- Herring\n\n3. Houston Rockets\n\nRecord: 44-26\n\nJames Harden would rather not discuss the soreness he's dealing with in his neck and right wrist. \"I'm all right,\" he said, but his individual efficiency has dipped significantly in March (47.0 effective field goal percentage and 53.6 true shooting percentage, both by far his lowest in a month this season). Nevertheless, the Rockets are rolling, outscoring opponents by 10 points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor in March, by far his best net rating in a month this season. -- MacMahon\n\n4. Toronto Raptors\n\nRecord: 49-21\n\nThe Raptors' odds of catching the Bucks for the East's top seed are slim after a 4-4 start to March. They keep failing to take advantage of opportunities to make up ground, getting beaten by the Pistons (twice) and Cavaliers after Milwaukee losses this month. -- MacMahon\n\n5. Denver Nuggets\n\nRecord: 46-22\n\nThe Nuggets bounced back from their blowout loss to the Warriors with three straight home wins to again close to within a game of the top seed in the West. The Nuggets are playing very balanced basketball right now, with five different leading scorers in their past five games. They embark on four-game road trip this week, including tough games in Boston and Indiana bracketing contests against two lottery-bound squads. -- Snellings\n\n6. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nRecord: 45-25\n\nIt definitely doesn't appear that rust has been an issue for Joel Embiid after he missed eight games due to left knee soreness, taking his time to come back as a precautionary measure. If anything, he looks refreshed. The Sixers are 4-0 since the All-Star big man's return, with Embiid's numbers during the stretch (27.8 points, 15.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks per game) even better than usual. -- MacMahon\n\n7. Portland Trail Blazers\n\nRecord: 42-27\n\nGuard CJ McCollum and the Blazers breathed a sigh of relief when he was diagnosed with a popliteus strain in his left knee. With McCollum out for at least a week, Portland will need some scoring from usual reserve guard Rodney Hood. Hood is averaging 11.3 points and 1.6 made 3-pointers per game in March. The five-year NBA veteran scored a season-high 27 points against Charlotte on March 3. -- Spears\n\n8. Boston Celtics\n\nRecord: 43-27\n\nThe Celtics have won five of their past six games, and they appear to be getting on the same page in preparation for a playoffs run. However, they lost both Al Horford and Gordon Hayward to injury in their Saturday game with the Hawks. Horford returned, but according to Brad Stevens, he is slated to sit at least \"three or four games\" in their next 12 for rest purposes. Hayward's status is unknown, but his potential absence would open more time for Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart to pick up the slack. -- Snellings\n\n9. San Antonio Spurs\n\nRecord: 41-29\n\nThe two players the Spurs received in the Kawhi Leonard deal have been driving forces during the NBA's longest active win streak. DeMar DeRozan's contributions during the eight-game run are obvious from scanning box scores, as he is averaging 21.0 points on 52.4 percent shooting, 6.0 rebounds and 6.4 assists. Jakob Poeltl has been a dominant defensive force, as the Spurs have allowed only 92.4 points per 100 possessions with the big man on the floor during the streak, in which he has blocked 2.4 shots in 26.5 minutes per game. -- MacMahon\n\n10. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nRecord: 42-28\n\nThe Thunder had an up-and-down week, starting with two straight wins before falling to the Pacers and Warriors. Paul George has struggled with his efficiency in his seven games back after a shoulder injury, making only 36.2 percent of his shots from the field, but he has averaged 30.0 PPG and 9.3 RPG in his past three to indicate that he is working the rust off. This week, the Thunder face the Heat plus a tough home-and-away set with the Raptors. -- Snellings\n\n11. LA Clippers\n\nRecord: 41-30\n\nThe Clippers have won seven of their past eight games to open an almost insurmountable lead for the eighth and final playoff spot out West. With the postseason seemingly assured, their next goal should be to move up and out of the eighth spot and a likely first-round date with the two-time defending champion Warriors. The Clippers are still within three games of the fourth-seeded Trail Blazers, giving them something to chase down the stretch. -- Snellings\n\n12. Utah Jazz\n\nRecord: 40-29\n\nDerrick Favors is arguably playing as well as he ever has for the Jazz and certainly since Utah emerged as a playoff team. He's averaging 14.8 points on 60.3 percent shooting, 9.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 25.6 minutes per game during the All-Star break. He has developed a terrific pick-and-roll rapport with Joe Ingles, who has assisted on 30 of Favors' 70 buckets in the dozen games since the break, with half of those dimes resulting in dunks. -- MacMahon\n\n13. Indiana Pacers\n\nRecord: 44-26\n\nThe Pacers' emotional, come-from-behind home win over Paul George and the Thunder this past week perfectly exemplified this Indiana team. The club, still stinging from the loss of Victor Oladipo, struggled for long stretches to score. But the team's smothering defense allowed it to chip away at a 19-point deficit before snatching victory from the jaws of defeat on a game-winning tip by Wesley Matthews. In the past two-plus seasons, the Pacers have won an NBA-high 15 games in which they trailed by 15 points or more. -- Herring\n\n14. Detroit Pistons\n\nRecord: 36-33\n\nDetroit is one of the hardest teams in the NBA to peg lately. The Pistons won 12 of 14 leading into last week, then got absolutely blasted by Miami and Brooklyn on the road, by 28 and 34 points, respectively. Regaining a rhythm soon would be ideal: They begin their longest road trip of the season -- five games, with four out west -- this week. -- Herring\n\n15. Orlando Magic\n\nRecord: 33-38\n\nThe Magic remain in a tight battle with the Heat and Hornets for the final playoff spot in the East, but thus far, they haven't been able to take advantage of a relatively weak stretch in their schedule. They lost two straight games that they couldn't afford to the Grizzlies and the Wizards, though they were able to bounce back to beat the Cavaliers and Hawks. The Magic play only twice this week, but both are home games against lottery opponents. -- Snellings\n\n16. Brooklyn Nets\n\nRecord: 36-36\n\nThe Nets started their brutal, 14-game stretch by blowing out the Pistons at home, then losing three straight on the road to the Thunder, Jazz and Clippers. They get the closest thing to a reprieve in their schedule this week, with only two games against the currently lottery-bound Kings and Lakers, with plenty of rest days in between. These are almost must-wins in an otherwise daunting set of upcoming games. -- Snellings\n\n17. Miami Heat\n\nRecord: 33-36\n\nThe Heat had a tough schedule last week, dropping games to the first-place Bucks and second-place Raptors but sneaking wins against the Pistons and Hornets. Things don't get any easier this week, as they start a four-game road trip that includes stops in Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Milwaukee and Washington. The Heat have moved Hassan Whiteside to a role off the bench, and in the short term, it has paid off, with Whiteside delivering four double-doubles in six games while new starter Bam Adebayo has averaged 14.4 points and 7.6 boards in his past five games. -- Snellings\n\n18. Sacramento Kings\n\nRecord: 34-35\n\nThe Kings' hopes of making the playoffs for the first time since 2006 have all but faded after they lost three of their past four games. But there is something else for the Kings to shoot for: a plus-.500 record. The last time Sacramento had a .500 record was the 2005-06 season, when it went 44-38. -- Spears\n\n19. Washington Wizards\n\nRecord: 30-40\n\nHe'd come close to accomplishing it before, but Bradley Beal notched back-to-back 40-point performances for the first time in his career this past weekend. He was highly efficient, needing just 29 and 17 shots, respectively, to get there. He's averaging 31.2 points per game since the All-Star break, third in the NBA behind Karl-Anthony Towns and James Harden. -- Herring\n\n20. Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nRecord: 32-38\n\nWith the playoffs an extreme long shot, the Timberwolves appear to be looking for the future, and rookie forward Keita Bates-Diop has recently seen a jump in playing time. The second-round pick is averaging 8.7 points and 3.9 rebounds in 26.4 minutes per game in March; the former Ohio State star played a total of 44 minutes in February. -- Spears\n\n21. Charlotte Hornets\n\nRecord: 31-38\n\nThe Hornets had a doubly disappointing loss to the Heat, which pushed them two games behind Miami for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Hornets are not helping their playoff push, as they have lost seven of their past 10 games. While Charlotte is finished playing Miami this regular-season, the Hornets end the campaign hosting Orlando on April 10 in a game that could have playoff implications. -- Spears\n\n22. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nRecord: 31-39\n\nLeBron James will face Giannis Antetokounmpo on Tuesday in Milwaukee. James has career averages of 27.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists in 18 games against Antetokounmpo, and the Greek Freak has averaged 21.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists in 18 games against James. LeBron scored 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and Antetokounmpo had 16 points and 15 rebounds when the Bucks won the first meeting this season on March 1 in Los Angeles. -- Spears\n\n23. New Orleans Pelicans\n\nRecord: 30-42\n\nElfrid Payton joined an exclusive list of players who put up four straight triple-doubles. According to Basketball Reference, the only other active players who have done it are Russell Westbrook (seven times) and James Harden. The only others who did it in the past 35 years: Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. Payton is averaging 14.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 13.3 assists during the triple-double streak, but the Pelicans lost all four of those games. -- MacMahon\n\n24. Memphis Grizzlies\n\nRecord: 28-42\n\nJonas Valanciunas has thrived since arriving in Memphis as part of the package the Grizzlies received for Marc Gasol. Valanciunas has averaged 17.9 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting 58.2 percent from the floor in 12 games for the Grizzlies, who are 5-7 when the 7-footer suits up. If he continues to play this well, Valanciunas will have an interesting decision to make regarding his player option worth $17.6 million next season. -- MacMahon\n\n25. Dallas Mavericks\n\nRecord: 28-41\n\nRookie guard Jalen Brunson has been a bright spot for the struggling Mavs since the All-Star break, seizing the opportunity after trades opened a starting role. He is averaging 16.3 points and 4.5 assists with a 65.0 true shooting percentage the past month. He has also proven that he fits well next to Luka Doncic, as that duo has a positive net rating during that span, despite the Mavs' 2-10 record. \"He's certainly building a case that he's a big part of our core young guys going forward, for sure,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. -- MacMahon\n\nBelieve it or not, the Suns have gone from laughable to beating the Warriors on the road and winning six of their past 10 games. Winning, however, could become costly for the Suns. The teams with the three worst regular-season records will each have a 14 percent chance of landing the No. 1 pick. New York has the NBA's worst record (14-56) followed by Phoenix (17-54), Cleveland (17-53) and Chicago (19-52). But if the Suns keep winning ... -- Spears\n\n28. Chicago Bulls\n\nRecord: 19-52\n\nAfter enjoying an 11-game streak of scoring 20 points or more, Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen has failed to reach the 20-point mark in eight consecutive games. Perhaps more concerning than the regression to the scoring mean is Markkanen's slight dip in rebounding and unusually porous defense in that span. Efficiency will come and go at times. But he's too talented to let the scoring struggles impact other facets of his game, which are generally solid. -- Herring\n\n29. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nRecord: 17-53\n\nThe Cavaliers came up with perhaps their most surprising win of the season this past week, when they dominated a fully healthy Raptors club in a 25-point rout. Cleveland had six players finish in double-figures, including Brandon Knight, who's finally healthy. He shot 50 percent from the field and averaged nearly 13 points per night during a recent four-game stretch. -- Herring\n\n30. New York Knicks\n\nRecord: 14-56\n\nThe Knicks had lost eight straight games before their late rally against the Lakers on Sunday, and they continue to \"try out\" players for roles next season. Emmanuel Mudiay and Damyean Dotson have been getting the recent run as the starting backcourt, and both have responded well, with averages around 20 PPG in their past three games. Meanwhile, veteran DeAndre Jordan has become a fixture in the middle after his return from injury, grabbing 13 or more rebounds in five of his past six games. -- Snellings",

    "title": "Rachel Roddy's recipe for creme caramel",
    "body": "A proper creme caramel should be 'like sinking into a comfortable chair'\n\nWhile the creme caramel at Trattoria Da Cesare al Casaletto may be the best in Rome (so good that an Arab princess once offered to fly Leonardo, the owner, to her palace to teach her chef how to make it, but he couldn't go), the one I enjoy most is at our local pizzeria, Remo. It's not so much about the creme caramel itself (which might be packet mix), but more about the whys and wherefores. It's most likely Friday night and the end of a long week, we don't have to cook, the noise of the place feels celebratory and the seats are so tight that kids can't wriggle around. We've already eaten fried salt cod and rice suppl\u00ec with mozzarella hearts, a pizza each with a side order of puntarelle (bitter leaf salad with a rowdy, anchovy-and-garlic dressing), drunk at least a litre of red wine and now find ourselves in need of pudding.\n\nWhile some people don't like to share puddings, or scorn those who have just a spoonful, I appreciate both - you get to taste a bit of everything, or satisfy that need for a full stop of sweetness. The options at Remo are half a dozen: fruit (pineapple frills in winter, watermelon fans in summer), tubs of ice-cream, jam tarts or three things that wobble: crema catalana, panna cotta and creme caramel. All three are slightly grainy, slightly too firm and, to be honest, only slightly good. They are never inverted in the middle of the plate, but sometimes they are exactly what you need.\n\nOther times, I do want something better than \"slightly good\". I wish I could remember who described the best panna cotta as \"silky and untroubled\", so I could thank them, because the best creme caramel should have the same qualities. Or, as my old neighbour Vera would have it, \"When sinking your spoon into the cream, it should feel like kicking your shoes off or sinking back into a comfortable chair.\"\n\nI know learning to make something with an Italian nonna is a tired cliche, but I did learn to make creme caramel with one. Vera, who was elegant and witty, also taught me Italian and to do anti-ageing neck exercises. I have slightly adapted her recipe over the years, incorporating bits from Delia Smith, who has helpful instructions such as \"cook the caramel until it is three shades darker than golden syrup\", but I don't bake it for as long as her or Vera, because I like a bit more wobble.\n\nCreme caramel\n\nPrep 10 min, plus chilling\n\nCook 40 min\n\nServes 4 (6 if you make a big single mould)\n\n100g caster sugar\n\n2 tbsp hot water\n\n150ml whole milk\n\n275ml single cream\n\nVanilla essence or 1 vanilla pod\n\n4 large eggs\n\n30g soft brown sugar\n\nHeat the oven to 150C (130 fan)/gas 2 and put a one and a half pint dish or four ramekins on a baking tray.\n\nTo make the caramel, heat the caster sugar and two tablespoons of water in a heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat, until the sugar dissolves. Leave to bubble, stirring, for a minute, or until you have a liquid that, as Delia suggests, is three shades darker than golden syrup. Off the heat, carefully add two tablespoons of hot water - it may splutter. Stir until you have a smooth liquid once more, then pour the caramel into the mould/ramekins, coating the sides.\n\nTo make the custard, pour the milk and cream into a pan. If you are using a vanilla pod, spilt it down the middle, scrape out the seeds and add to the milk/cream mixture along with the empty pod. Leave to infuse for 30 minutes.\n\nIn a bowl, beat the eggs, soft brown sugar and vanilla essence, if using. Heat the milk mixture again, until hot (but not boiling), remove the vanilla pod, if using, and pour into the egg/sugar mixture. Whisk until everything is combined, then remove from the heat.\n\nDivide the custard between the ramekins/moulds. Boil the kettle, the pour the boiling water into the baking tray, so it comes halfway up the sides of the mould/ramekins. Bake for 30 minutes, leave to cool, then chill until completely cold. Remove from the fridge an hour before serving. When it comes to inverting, ease a knife around the sides of the custard, and invert on to a lipped plate.",

    "title": "Low Carbon Heat Recovered from Wastewater: Second District Heat Network Powered by SHARC Energy Technology",
    "body": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 18, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sharc International Systems Inc. (CSE: SHRC) (FSE: IWIA) (OTCQB: INTWF) (\"SHARC\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce that the Company's UK subsidiary SHARC Energy Systems (\"SHARC Energy\") have been appointed to support the development of the new low temperature District Heating Scheme (\"DHS\") in Stirling, Scotland.\n\nThe $10.6M (\u00a36M) project is being developed between Stirling Council and Scottish Water Horizons, who have contracted FES Support Services Ltd. as the main contractor to Design and Build the heat network and Energy centre to be located on the Stirling Forthside Wastewater Treatment Works. The new SHARC installation will be the second District Heating Scheme in the UK to adopt SHARC Sewage Heat Recovery, with work due to complete in spring 2019.\n\nSHARC Energy will work with main contractors FES Support Services Ltd. to Design, Build and Operate (\"DBO\") the Sewage Heat Recovery system and support an ongoing operating activity to deliver the 4th generation district heating service, designed to operate at a 60/40 flow and return temperature in the Forthside area of the town. The network will provide heating to several private and publicly owned buildings, with scope for the network to be expanded across the city to include homes, helping tackle fuel poverty and provide financial savings for businesses.\n\nSHARC Energy's technology reclaims heat from the waste water that homes and businesses pour down the drain every day, reusing it to generate low-carbon, low cost, sustainable clean heat that can displace the use of carbon intensive natural gas and other fossil fuels.\n\nThis scheme, alongside the new 2 MW capacity District Heating Scheme currently being built by SHARC Energy in the Dalmarnock area of the Clyde Gateway regeneration program, provides further evidence of the opportunity to use large scale heat pumps to support the growing appetite for low carbon district heating now emerging across the UK.\n\nUK-based SHARC Energy, a wholly owned European arm of Vancouver-based International Wastewater Systems Inc. (CSE: SHRC) (FRANKFURT: IWIA), has adopted Glasgow as its home for expansion across the UK and wider European Union, creating jobs and furthering the development of Scotland's low carbon economy. The Canadian company has built a strong pipeline of projects across the UK, with a growing interest in using the pioneering renewable heat technology to help businesses make vital savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions.\n\nCommenting on the new contract, SHARC's Chief Operating Officer Russ Burton said, \"The value of the waste water that flows beneath the streets of the world is a vital and largely untapped resource that could support a significant uptake of highly efficient Water Source heat pumps in Urban Centres, where space restrictions limit alternative approaches. By capturing some of the massive energy reserves held in our sewers we can significantly contribute to the circular economy and reduce the carbon emissions & other air pollutants that arise from combustion-based heating.\"\n\nBurton continued \"By taking a sub-contract role in the scheme and supporting FES Support Services Ltd. with our specialist services, this project provides us with an opportunity to explore how our business model can be flexed to create more opportunities to deploy our technology and we are hugely excited to work with the Stirling project team to ensure the success of this development.\"\n\n\"As we start 2019 on a continued growth curve, I am very thrilled about the development of the new Stirling district heating scheme and working with FES and the wider Stirling District Heating Team, reaffirming our commitment from both sides of the pond to Scotland's low carbon plans,\" said Lynn Mueller, CEO of SHARC. \"The formation of this strategic relationship that Russell and his team has put together is another step forward for SHARC and is part of our ongoing commitment to carbon emissions reduction with our customers through our technology.\"\n\nAbout SHARC Energy Ltd. (UK)\n\nSHARC Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of SHARC International Inc. a world leader in wastewater heat recovery, based in Vancouver British Columbia and a public company trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE: SHRC) & Frankfurt B\u00f6rse (FRANKFURT: IWI).\n\nLocated in Glasgow and Nottinghamshire, the UK operation delivers sewage heat recovery technology and support services across the wider UK and EU.\n\nRuss Burton (SHARC International Inc. Chief Operating Officer and head of European Operations) has worked at a senior level in the property and commercial sectors for thirty years.

(Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press)\n\nCharlotte shot a season-worst 31 percent from the field and 19 percent from 3-point range. They were also the best numbers of the season for the Heat defense in both categories.\n\nIt was 39-39 at the half, a 24-minute stretch that featured one clank after another.\n\nThe Heat shot 33 percent, the Hornets shot 35 percent, and they combined to go 7 for 35 (20 percent) from 3-point range. Charlotte's entire starting five was a combined 5 for 24 in the half.\n\nAdebayo was 5 for 8 for Miami, but the other four Heat starters were 3 for 21 -- Josh Richardson and Waiters going 0 for 13.

It was the 36th and almost certainly final time that Parker got to play against Wade, including their NBA Finals matchups in 2013 and 2014. ...

Miami used its 24th different starting lineup.\n\nSLOW START\n\nThere have been five games in the NBA this season where neither team reached 40 points by halftime -- and Miami has been in three of them. The 39 points tied Miami's fourth-worst first half total of the season, and was Charlotte's third-worst total.\n\nEARLY START\n\nThe 1 p.m. local tip time was the earliest of the season for the Heat -- for now. Miami has a noon game at Toronto on April 7. Charlotte has now played a pair of 1 p.m. starts this season; the Hornets lost 118-108 to Portland in an early start on March 3.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHornets: Host Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nHeat: Visit Oklahoma City on Monday.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

    "title": "Every bite of these classic Mexican chiles rellenos makes the time you put into them worth it",
    "body": "Overview Ingredients Steps\n\nOverview\n\nIs there a dish you always order, no matter what else is on the menu? For me, it's chile relleno. I started ordering the stuffed-, battered- and fried-pepper dish in my West Texas childhood, and haven't stopped during a lifetime of eating at Mexican restaurants here and in Mexico. I've made them at home, too, sometimes battering and frying them the traditional way and sometimes baking. The latter can be perfectly satisfying with the right sauce and filling, but it's the former I truly crave.\n\nThe whole shebang takes some time, but I love the dish so much and think you will, too (if you don't already), that I'm breaking my easy-enough-for-a-weeknight rule to walk you through a stellar version. It comes from chef Gabriel Camara's beautiful new book, which showcases the kind of contemporary Mexican cooking she serves in her Mexico City and San Francisco restaurants, Contramar and Cala, respectively.\n\nI said stellar, not simple. This recipe would be just the thing to make on a weekend, or perhaps spread out: On one day, make the sauce and the refried beans, and roast and peel -- or even stuff -- the poblano chiles. On another, batter and fry the chiles, and finish cooking them in the sauce.\n\nCamara suggests another shortcut: stuffing dried ancho chiles instead of fresh poblanos. (They're the same pepper in different forms.) It's easier because you don't have to roast and peel the anchos; you just soak them until they're soft. They even hold together a little better after you stuff them. You still have to try to get those pesky seeds out without ripping the pepper to pieces, but that, too, goes a little more quickly than with the poblanos, because the seeds don't stick as much.\n\nI tested it both ways, stuffing poblanos with refried beans and mozzarella, and anchos with beans and goat cheese. The combination of eggy batter, sharp tomato sauce, earthy beans and rich cheese took me right back to Mexico City. I like the fresh, herbaceous bite of the poblanos a little better than the deeper ancho, but it's really like picking between your two favorite children. They're both wonderful.\n\nNOTE: Refrigerate (separately) the roasted, peeled chiles; refried beans; and tomato sauce for up to 1 week. Refrigerate the stuffed poblanos for up to 3 days.\n\nThese make excellent leftovers, eaten cold or warm in a taco or on a sandwich.\n\nAn instant-read thermometer is helpful for monitoring the frying oil.\n\nIngredients\n\n6 large poblano peppers (may substitute 6 large dried ancho chiles; see VARIATION)\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nOne 15-ounce can no-salt-added black beans, with their liquid\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed\n\n1 white onion, chopped\n\n2 cloves garlic\n\nOne 28-ounce can whole tomatoes or diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup water\n\n4 ounces (about 1 cup) shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese (may substitute soft goat cheese; see VARIATION)\n\n2 large eggs\n\n2 cups safflower oil, sunflower oil or any other high-smoke-point vegetable oil\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPosition an oven rack 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element; preheat to broil.\n\nStep 2\n\nPlace the poblanos on a baking sheet; broil until they brown in spots and blister without charring, watching them carefully and turning them with tongs until they are blistered all over. (If they char all over, they may become too soft to work with easily.) Transfer them to a heatproof bowl and cover with a plate or pan lid to let them steam and cool enough to be handled, at least 10 minutes.\n\nStep 3\n\nWhile the peppers are steaming, make the refried beans and tomato sauce: Pour 1 tablespoon of the extra-virgin olive oil into a large Dutch oven or large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the beans and their liquid, plus 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the beans, and stir until they bubble and thicken. Turn off the heat, taste, and add more salt as needed. Transfer to a bowl, then rinse out the pot and return it to the stove.\n\nStep 4\n\nCombine the onion, garlic, tomatoes, the water and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender; puree until smooth.\n\nStep 5\n\nPut the now-clean pot you used for the beans over medium-high heat, and pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon of the extra-virgin olive oil. When it shimmers, pour in the pureed tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is barely bubbling. Taste, and add more salt as needed. Let the sauce cook while you stuff and fry the peppers.\n\nStep 6\n\nWhen the poblanos are cool enough to handle, use your fingers to carefully remove and discard their skins. Make a vertical slit from the stem end to the tip of each pepper and pull out the seeds, being as gentle as possible so as to not tear the peppers any more than is necessary.\n\nStep 7\n\nPlace the roasted chiles on a platter, slit sides up. Stuff each chile with 2 to 3 tablespoons (depending on the size of the chiles) of the cheese and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the refried beans. Don't overstuff; better to have leftover filling than to not be able to close the chiles, or to have them burst during frying. Pinch the chiles closed; their flesh should stick to the filling, but if you need, you can thread toothpicks through the opening to help keep them closed.\n\nStep 8\n\nCrack the eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the balloon-whisk attachment, or use a handheld electric mixer and a medium bowl. Whip the eggs until they expand, become super-thick and foamy, and form very soft, temporary peaks when you lift out the whisk, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nStep 9\n\nPour the 2 cups of oil into a deep skillet over medium-high heat. When it reaches 375 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, fry the chiles. Use your hands to gently dip each stuffed pepper into the whipped eggs, carefully flipping it over so both sides get coated and using a spatula, as needed, to help coat them evenly.\n\nStep 10\n\nCarefully lower each coated pepper into the hot oil; fry until the coating puffs and turns golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat, frying 2 or 3 chiles at a time. As they are done, lift them with a slotted spoon, letting any excess oil drip back into the pot, and carefully transfer them to the pot of hot tomato sauce. Repeat until all the poblanos are in the sauce. Don't worry about crowding them; once they are fried, they can withstanding some jostling.\n\nStep 11\n\nIncrease the heat to bring the tomato sauce back to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is barely bubbling. Cook the chiles for 5 minutes, until they are heated through. (Feel free to leave them cooking in the sauce for longer if you're finishing other parts of the dinner or waiting for guests; you really can't overcook them.)\n\nStep 12\n\nServe the chiles hot, with the sauce spooned over.\n\nVARIATION: To use dried ancho chiles instead of fresh, soak them in very hot water for about 1 hour, until softened. Pat them dry, then slit, stuff and fry them according to the directions above, substituting the goat cheese for the mozzarella.\n\nAdapted from \"My Mexico City Kitchen,\" by Gabriela Camara (Lorena Jones Books, 2019).\n\nTested by Joe Yonan; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.\n\nDid you make this recipe?

    "title": "Beyond the sea: Gill Meller's spring seafood recipes",
    "body": "Pickled mussels, grilled oysters, clams with sausage: the recipes that remind River Cottage chef Gill Meller of home\n\nMarch seems to mark heartwarming changes in my seaside town of Lyme Regis. The cold wet days are carried away by a milder, kinder type of breeze, and on it there's a feeling of spring. The smaller fishing boats put back into the water, and the putt-putt-putt of their engines adds a new layer to the morning chorus. The smells of this wakening up of the season intensify my love of this place, and the sea and the food that belong to it; the smells of chips cooking and low tides, of vinegar and stone, of beach fires and fresh fish. These recipes connect me to this place and this time of year. There are plump pickled mussels in apple-cider vinegar to be piled on buttered brown bread. I've included an oyster dish that is as delicious as it is easy, and I think I've pieced together Mum's fish pie - at least, it tastes pretty similar.\n\nGrilled oysters in smoked bacon and wild garlic butter\n\nGrilling oysters might seem at odds with popular convention, we're so used to eating them raw, straight from the shell, but it wasn't always that way. Oysters used to be cooked like other shellfish tends to be - steamed, fried and even popped in pies. Cooking them like this gives them a completely different feel, perfect for anyone who finds live oysters a challenge.\n\nServes 2\n\noysters 12 Pacific or native\n\nsmoked streaky bacon 2 rashers\n\ngood olive oil\n\nunsalted butter 50g, soft\n\nwild garlic 6-8 small leaves, rinsed and finely chopped\n\nfreshly ground black pepper\n\nfresh white breadcrumbs 4 tbsp, coarse\n\npecorino or other hard sheep's cheese 2 tbsp, finely grated\n\nTo shuck an oyster you'll need an oyster knife (one with a sturdy, short blade) and a tea towel to protect your hand from the sharp shell (and the sharp knife). Hold the oyster firmly, cupped-side down in the tea towel, resting your hand on a chopping board, with the shell's hinge facing towards you. Insert the knife tip downwards between the two halves of the shell at the pointed back end, at the hinge. Lever the shell open a little, then slip the knife along the underside of the top half of the shell, severing the oyster's adductor muscle and fully opening the shell. Carefully slide the knife blade underneath the oyster to release it completely. Try to save any liquor in the shell. Shuck the oysters one by one, leaving them in the shell in their juices while you prepare the smoked bacon and wild garlic butter.\n\nDice the bacon into small pieces. Heat a little pan and trickle in a dash of oil. Add the diced bacon and cook, stirring regularly, until it is just cooked.\n\nTip the cooked bacon and any fat out into a bowl. When it's cooled a little, add the soft butter, chopped wild garlic and a good twist of black pepper, and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon.\n\nPlace the oysters on a large shallow roasting tray. A crumpled sheet of foil can help to keep them upright. Divide the butter equally between the oysters then place the whole tray directly under a preheated grill. Cook the oysters for 3 minutes. While that's happening, combine the breadcrumbs with the grated cheese and a trickle of olive oil. Sprinkle this mixture over the oysters then return them to the grill for a further 2-4 minutes or until they have turned a golden brown. Serve at once.\n\nPotted crab\n\nThere's a fisherman called Matt who runs a small yellow boat out of the harbour. In a month or so he'll be landing cuttlefish, then later in the summer he will be taking out day-trippers for mackerel. Right now he's landing brown crab, and I'm lucky enough to have his mobile number. If you can't find fresh whole crab on the high street try Sole of Discretion, an ethical fishmonger in Devon, who'll send you super-fresh picked crab meat direct.\n\nServes 4-6\n\nunsalted butter 150g, very soft\n\nshallots 2 small or 1 larger, very finely diced\n\nlemon thyme or common thyme 3-4 sprigs, leaves stripped and chopped\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nbrandy 2 tbsp\n\nfresh white crab meat 300g\n\ncayenne pepper 2 generous pinches\n\nunwaxed lemon juice and very finely grated zest of 1\n\nPlace a small knob of the butter in a small saucepan and set it over a low heat. When it's hot add the shallots, thyme leaves and some salt and pepper, stir and cook gently until the shallots are soft and translucent. Pour in the brandy and bring to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nPlace the remaining soft butter straight into the pan with the brandy and shallot mixture. Use a hand or electric whisk to beat the butter mixture until it's light and airy. Gently fold the crab meat into the butter along with the lemon juice and zest, and season everything with salt, pepper and the cayenne for warmth. Then transfer to four small ramekins or one larger individual dish.\n\nUse the back of a warm spoon to smooth over the surface of the crab. Sprinkle over a few extra thyme leaves and twist over some cracked black pepper.\n\nPlace the crab in the fridge until you are ready to serve. Remove it from the fridge at least 1 hour before you plan to eat it, otherwise it will be too cold.\n\nI like to serve this potted crab with plenty of warm crunchy toast and some pickled gherkins or cucumber.\n\nPickled mussels and brown bread\n\nQuite a lot of the mussels we enjoy eating in this country are \"rope grown\", meaning, quite literally, they are grown on ropes. It's a form of aquaculture that seems entirely positive, so we should all get behind it and cook more mussels. This recipe is far simpler than it appears, and it's super delicious. Serve as a starter or with drinks before a meal. Fresh brown bread and cold butter is an absolute must.\n\nServes 2 as a starter or 4 as a snack\n\nmussels 1kg, washed and debearded\n\nred onion 1 small, peeled, halved and very finely sliced\n\ncider vinegar 4 tbsp, good-quality\n\ngolden caster sugar 4 tsp\n\nbay leaves 2\n\nthyme sprigs 2\n\ncaraway seeds 1 tsp, toasted\n\ncoriander seeds 2 tsp, toasted and lightly crushed\n\nchives \u00bd small bunch, very finely chopped\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nPlace a large pan over a high heat. Add 100ml water and when it's boiling hard, tip in the mussels and place a close-fitting lid on the pan. Cook, shaking the pan once or twice, for 1-2 minutes, or until the mussel shells are all just open. Turn off the heat, then drain the mussels into a colander set over a bowl to catch the cooking liquor. Discard any mussels that haven't opened up.\n\nWhen the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the shells and place it in a bowl. Pour all but the last couple of tablespoons of the mussel liquor (which can be gritty) into a clean pan. Add the sliced onion, cider vinegar, sugar, bay, thyme and the toasted seeds.\n\nBring the mixture up to a simmer then switch off the heat and let it infuse and cool for 15-20 minutes. Pour the pickling liquor over the mussels, add the chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. You can, if you like, tweak the balance of sweetness or acidity by adding a dash more sugar or vinegar, respectively.\n\nThe mussels can be eaten straight away, but I think they improve if you can leave them for a few hours to steep.\n\nTo serve, pile the mussels and lots of lovely oniony juices onto thickly buttered brown bread, and enjoy.\n\nClams with sausage, chilli and fennel seed\n\nI've used Manila clams in this recipe, sustainably harvested from Poole Harbour in Dorset. They are a meaty, sweet clam and at this time of year they're not difficult to come by. Be sure to ask your fishmonger about them. This is one of my favourite ways to cook them. It's deeper and richer than most clam dishes and makes a perfect quick supper. Fennel seed, chilli and good herby pork sausages (with plenty of fat) work well with the clams, but if you can't find this versatile bivalve for any reason, you can make a very similar dish with mussels.\n\nServes 4\n\nolive oil 1 tbsp\n\nbutter a large knob\n\nfennel seeds 1 tbsp, lightly crushed\n\nchilli flakes a good pinch\n\npork sausages 6 free-range or organic, skinned and coarsely crumbled\n\nbay leaf 1\n\nonion 1 medium, peeled and finely diced\n\ngarlic 4 cloves, peeled and grated or finely chopped\n\nlemon zest of \u00bd small\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nchopped tomatoes 1 x 400g tin\n\nlive clams about 1.5kg\n\nflat-leaf parsley \u00bd small bunch , leaves picked and finely chopped\n\nextra virgin olive oil to finish\n\nPlace a large, heavy wide-based pan over a medium heat. Add the olive oil and the butter and when it's bubbling away add the fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Sizzle gently for 1-2 minutes. Now add the crumbled sausage and bay leaf. Fry the sausage meat on all sides until it's beginning to caramelise and it smells delicious. Add the diced onion, garlic, lemon zest and some salt and pepper and stir well. Cook, stirring regularly, for a further 4-6 minutes or until the onion is beginning to soften. Tip in the chopped tinned tomatoes and half a tin of water and stir well. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook uncovered for 25-30 minutes. If it looks a little dry at any point add a dash more water. Taste the sauce and season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\nRinse the clams thoroughly in fresh water, discarding any that remain open or have broken shells. Turn the heat up a little under the sauce and add the clams. Stir once or twice, then set a lid down on the pan. Cook the clams for 2 minutes giving the pan a shake and a shuffle once or twice as they cook.\n\nRemove the lid, sprinkle in the chopped parsley, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, and stir everything once. Discard any clams that haven't opened. Bring the pan to the table and serve with buttered bread, mashed potato or a rich wet polenta.\n\nMum's fish pie\n\nThis is my interpretation of my mum's fish pie and I think it's pretty close. The thing is, she never wrote any of her recipes down, so if I try and recreate something she made, I do it by memory. The memories I have of being in the kitchen with her as she prepared the smoked fish, shelled the mussels, chopped the parsley and mashed the spuds.\n\nServes 8\n\nFor the filling\n\nfresh live mussels 800g, washed and debearded\n\nfree-range eggs 6, at room temperature\n\nbutter 125g\n\nflour 100g\n\nleeks 2 medium, split, washed and thinly sliced\n\nwhole milk 500ml, warmed\n\ndouble cream 200ml\n\nnatural smoked haddock 600g, skinned and cubed\n\nwhiting, hake or cod fillet 400g, skinned and cubed\n\nflat-leaf parsley 1 bunch, leaves picked and finely chopped\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nFor the topping\n\nwhite floury potatoes about 1.2kg, peeled and cut into large chunks\n\nbutter 100g\n\nwhole milk 150ml\n\ncourse white breadcrumbs 2-3 tbsp\n\nmature cheddar cheese 2-3 tbsp\n\nsalt and black pepper\n\nPlace a large pan over a high heat. Add 100ml water and when it's boiling hard, tip in the mussels and put on a close-fitting lid. Cook, shaking the pan once or twice, for 1-2 minutes, or until the mussel shells are just open. Drain them into a colander set over a bowl to catch the cooking liquor, and reserve. Discard any mussels that haven't opened up.\n\nWhen the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the shells and place it in a bowl.\n\nCook the eggs in boiling water for 6-7 minutes. Drain them and carefully peel them when they've cooled a bit.\n\nBring the potatoes to the boil in a plenty of salted water. Cook for 20-25 minutes or until they are really tender. Drain and allow them to steam off for 5 minutes then return them to the pan. Mash the potatoes thoroughly. Then beat in the butter and milk. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nPreheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nPlace a large heavy-based pan on a medium heat and add 25g of the butter. When it's hot add the leeks, season and cook stirring regularly for 6-8 minutes or until they are soft. Lift the leeks from the pan to a plate, return the pan to the heat and add the rest of the butter. When it's bubbling away add the flour, stir well and cook for a minute or so. Now gradually add the warm milk and the mussel liquor (except the very last bit which can be gritty), and stir until you have a smooth thick sauce. Allow the sauce to cook away gently for 4-5 minutes then add the cream and the cubed fish, along with the mussels, leeks and chopped parsley. Season well with salt and pepper and carefully stir everything together.\n\nHalve the eggs and arrange them over the base of a large baking dish. Ladle the fish and sauce over the top, level it out then carefully spoon over the warm mash. Sprinkle the top of the pie with the breadcrumbs and cheese and place in the oven to bake for about 25-30 minutes until piping hot and golden on top.\n\nAllow the pie to cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nThe Guardian and Observer aim to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

    "title": "Joe Trivelli's new winter vegetable recipes",
    "body": "Simple ways to transform basic ingredients into something really special\n\nI tend to rely largely on pulses and other dry-store ingredients as winter has its curtain call, but as keen as I am on soft Italian overstewed vegetables, here I have taken a fresher approach - hinting at my longing for food with spring in its step.\n\nWithout using anything more exotic than the contents of my winter veg box - beetroot, carrots, potatoes - I have injected the flavours with new life: almost acidic winter tomatoes, a kick of horseradish, the punch of some good vinegar to awaken and restore.\n\nI love the combination of tomato and horseradish; something I learned from Elizabeth David and have used here in a simple beetroot salad.\n\nPotatoes and pork\n\nI described this idea to a friend; he beat me to making it and convinced me to include it here. Salty, savoury and heady from herbs and juniper, this makes a strong side or simple supper with a salad.\n\nServes 4\n\nbay leaves 5, fresh\n\nrosemary 1 sprig\n\nparsley 1 sprig\n\njuniper berries 7\n\nred potatoes 800g\n\npancetta 400g or 2 thick slices\n\nolive oil\n\nchillies 2, fresh\n\nmustard seeds 1 tbsp\n\ngarlic 2 cloves, peeled and chopped\n\nCarefully remove the centre rib out from the bay leaves and grind the leaves to dust in a mortar with a pinch of salt. This will take a bit of patience. Then add the other herbs and the juniper berries and grind.\n\nIf you like, peel the potatoes, just in strips will do, otherwise just chop them into 5cm thick random shapes. Boil them in lightly salted water until soft but not mushy. Drain.\n\nHeat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nCut the pancetta into 2cm cubes and fry over a medium heat in a tablespoon of olive oil. They will eventually crisp once much of the fat has rendered.\n\nAt this point roughly chop the chillies and add to the pan, with the mustard seeds - they will pop in a satisfying way. Then add the potatoes and garlic, turning them over and coating with all the flavours and not minding if they get bashed up a bit. Then stir in the ground herbs and enjoy the aroma.\n\nMove to a roasting dish and roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are crispy.\n\nBeetroot salad\n\nI like to make this refreshing salad with beets cold from the fridge. The order in which to make this tries to mitigate against the beetroot massacre (blood bath) that will inevitably happen.\n\nServes 4 as a starter or a side\n\nwinter tomatoes 300g, or another type\n\noregano 1 tsp, dried\n\nhorseradish root \u2153, around 60g\n\nbeetroot 2 medium, around 350g\n\nlemon \u00bd, juiced\n\nparsley 1 small bunch, roughly chopped\n\nolive oil\n\ncr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche optional\n\nCut the tomatoes into pieces. Place them in a large bowl with a good pinch of salt and oregano. Leave them alone for a bit. Peel and grate the horseradish. I use a microplane, but if you don't have one, maybe chop the horseradish for a finer finish after you have grated it.\n\nPeel the beetroot and slice them into matchsticks a couple of millimetres thick. Place them on to the tomatoes with the horseradish. Add the lemon juice, parsley and a really good glug of olive oil - around 6 tbsp. Combine.\n\nEat with a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche if you find the horseradish too hot.\n\nBraised vegetables\n\nThis is simple cooking that requires a bit of precision to be truly great. We ate it for lunch with a poached egg and a slice of rye bread.\n\nServes 4 as a starter or a side\n\nfennel 1 large bulb\n\ncarrots 4\n\nendives 2\n\ngarlic cloves 4\n\nblack olives 3 tbsp\n\nolive oil 4 tbsp\n\nartichokes 2, peeled and quartered, optional\n\nthyme 3 sprigs\n\nvinegar 2 tbsp\n\nhoney 2 tbsp\n\ndry vermouth 200ml\n\nbutter a good knob\n\nTrim the base of the fennel bulb and slice into 4 thick 3cm or so slices. Wash and peel the carrots. If large, slice into two across the middle on the bias, or lengthways if quite thick. Cut the endives in half lengthways, peel the garlic cloves and halve, removing the inevitable green shoots they have at this time of year. Pit the olives (or don't).\n\nIn a large, heavy frying pan, heat 2 tbsp of the oil and begin with the fennel, searing a little on both sides over a medium heat, with a pinch of salt, adding the endives once the fennel has been turned. Try and give everything its own place - if this is not possible, cook in batches. Add the garlic, carrots and artichokes, if you are including them. Pick the thyme leaves and sprinkle over the top. Arrange it all then add the vinegar, honey, olives and remaining oil. Quite quickly follow with the vermouth and enough water to just cover everything.\n\nPlace a lid on the pan, but leave a small gap so that the vegetables can stew while some steam escapes. Allow to tick away over a medium-low heat, checking regularly, for 35-45 minutes, until some of the endive leaves are translucent, the carrots are just softened enough, and the liquid has largely reduced.\n\nTurn the heat down low and carefully remove the vegetables to a warm serving dish. Turn the heat up on the liquid and reduce to a couple of tablespoons worth, then add the butter and swirl the pan around as it disappears, forming a glossy sauce. Pour this over the vegetables, add fresh black pepper and eat quickly.\n\nFrittelle di San Giuseppe\n\nThere are several versions of these fritters eaten on St Joseph's Day, 19 March. This is Father's Day, Festa del Pap\u00e0, in Italy and as such I reserve the right to change the recipe by adding rhubarb - they work with apple, too. They taste like childhood, even if they weren't part of yours.\n\nMakes about 20\n\nrisotto 150g, or other short-grain rice\n\nmilk 500ml\n\ncinnamon \u00bd stick, split\n\nlemon peeled rind of 1\n\nforced rhubarb 300g\n\ncaster sugar 70g, plus extra for dusting\n\nplain flour 75g\n\nbaking powder 1 tsp\n\negg 1\n\nsunflower oil 1 litre\n\nIn advance, bring the rice to the boil in equal parts water and milk with the split cinnamon, the peel from the lemon and a pinch of salt. Simmer over a low heat for an hour until the rice is overcooked and the consistency is mega-creamy. Remove the cinnamon and allow to cool completely. Chop the rhubarb into 5mm pieces and toss with 30g of the sugar.\n\nThen mix together the flour, baking powder, the rest of the sugar, egg, cold rice and rhubarb.\n\nHeat the oil on a high heat in a pot that can hold at least three times its volume. If you have a stable wok, I find it good for deep frying. When hot, test with a small piece of batter to see if it sizzles. When it does, you're ready to start.\n\nFry in tablespoon-sized nuggets in batches. Use 2 spoons to scrape pieces into the oil, taking great care you do not come into contact with the hot oil. Once the fritters have cooked on one side, turn using a slotted spoon. They should turn fully golden in about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper and dust with sugar before enjoying.\n\nJoe Trivelli is co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9",

    "title": "From juices to ice-creams, owners are taking steps to keep pets cool this summer - Times of India",
    "body": "THANE: From feeding pets a variety of fresh fruit juices to giving them ice-creams and taking them for early morning and late night walks, pet owners across the city are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to giving their furry friends a break from the rising summer heat.\n\nAs the mercury levels are rising every single day, the sultry climate has started affecting animals and birds. To avoid pets from getting dehydrated, many owners have started making changes in their diet. Some have also started providing a place where there is proper shade for strays. Sameet Ghone, from Vrindavan Society, said, \"I have a six-year-old golden retriever and I began noticing that the heat has been taking a toll on my pet. She used t get lethargic even during the day. So, I keep the air condition on or at times I keep her in the bathroom where it is cooler.\"\n\n\"To help her feel at ease, I also made some changes to her diet and included more juices and water. I even feed her at regular intervals to ease digestion. I have also started giving her curd or ice cream once in a while,\" Ghone added.\n\nMeanwhile, Balkum resident Sharmishtha Roy who recently got a pair of love birds said, \"I read that birds get extremely affected by the heat. So, I consulted a veterinarian and have changed the location of the bird cage. I shifted it to a cooler area in my home. I also keep plenty of water in the cage for them.\"\n\nBesides alterations ini their diet, some have also made changes to their pets daily routine. \"Taking our dog out for a walk after sunrise and before sunset is not only exhausting for him, but also extremely draining for me as it is too hot. Over the past few days, I have been getting up at around 4.30am and take my beagle for a nice walk before sunrise and after sunset,\" said Anjali Juneja, a Hiranandani Meadows resident.\n\nIn addition to ensuring that their pets are hydrated, vets are urging residents to avoid feeding or walking their pets in the afternoon. \"While ice-cream provides temporary coolness, dogs, cats or any pet requires plenty of water, juices and fluids to stay cool. They should not be fed in the afternoon as it adds to the body heat. They should not be left in cars without ACs on or taken for treks and walks when the sun has risen,\" said city-based veterinarian Dr. Hemant Thange.\n\n\"Taking them for a swim once in a while and adding ice cubes in their water bowls will give them some relief. While keeping the AC on is ideal for most pets, it is a must when it comes to dogs with a lot of fur like Alsatians, German Sheppards and others,\" Dr. Thange said.\n\nWhile ice-cream provides temporary coolness, dogs, cats or any pet requires plenty of water, juices and fluids to stay cool.

    "body": "The Brooklyn-based chef and food writer's book Dining In has unfussy recipes and brilliant tips to make you a better cook\n\n\"I want this to have a permanent place in your kitchen,\" says Alison Roman of her debut cookbook Dining In, published in the UK this month. \"I want the pages to be messy. I want you to learn something in each recipe that helps you become a better cook.\"\n\nThe titles alone are appetising - I, for one, was powerless to resist her anchovy-butter chicken with chicken-fat croutons, or her chocolate-tahini tart with crunchy salt - and Roman's breezy style carries you through the recipes with a minimum of fuss.\n\nA Los Angeleno who's been living in New York since 2010, Roman is big on Instagram (with 190,000 followers) and very much in tune with her audience, which leans towards the millennial. But the 33-year-old backs it all up with years of kitchen experience. She began cooking professionally aged 19, at the award-winning restaurant Sona in LA and later at Quince in San Francisco. \"The first few months were rough,\" she says, \"but I became good at it and I loved it, even though it was emotionally destroying me and I was so poor.\"\n\nThe move to New York in 2010 was intended as an escape from the rigours of cheffing - \"I got fatigued with the daily grind,\" she tells me - but it took another couple of years, including a stint at David Chang's Momofuku Milk Bar, before she got into food writing.\n\n\"A friend said, 'Bon App\u00e9tit is looking for recipe testers in the test kitchen,'\" she recalls. \"I said, 'Cool, what's that?'\" The magazine took her on and Roman found developing and writing recipes played to her strengths. \"One of my favourite parts of being a chef was teaching, explaining the hows and whys of cooking.\" This comes through in her cookbook, which is crammed with useful tips - add fish sauce to umami-deficient stews, drop an egg yolk into a radicchio salad - and lucid guidance where it's needed most.\n\nDining In was originally published in the US in 2017 and Roman, now a regular food columnist for the New York Times, is finishing the follow-up, Nothing Fancy, due out in the UK in October. She's apprehensive about how the two books will be received. \"All my favourite cookbooks are by UK authors,\" she says, citing her long-standing admiration for Diana Henry and Nigel Slater, \"so the fact that a UK publisher was interested in my book - oh my God, I was absolutely for it, but also very nervous.\"\n\nUltimately, she says: \"I'm writing for someone who's like me. I'm busy, I don't cook at home every night but, when I do, I really want to enjoy it. I want to simmer something for a long time, because that's how you should cook it and it smells great.\"\n\nSpiced black lentil salad with tuna, radish and purple potatoes\n\nThis is a sort of fridge-clean-out salad that always ends up looking fancier than it ought to. If I've got unused green beans, I blanch them. Potatoes about to turn green? I steam 'em. That way, I'm moments away from an almost intentional ni\u00e7oise salad. Yes, the spiced lentils here make this a truly special version, but if you have any cooked lentils and some good tinned tuna on hand, this works with just about anything else you might have lying around: shaved raw fennel or broccoli, roasted carrots or sweet potatoes from the night before - you name it.\n\nWhen it comes to buying the tuna, go ahead and splurge on the nice jarred or tinned stuff. Just make sure it's packed in olive oil, not spring water, because, yes, there is a huge difference. The stuff packed in oil tends to be richer and more luxurious, whereas the tuna packed in water can come across as dry or watery - or worse, dry and watery.\n\nServes 4\n\neggs 2 large\n\ngreen beans 100g, ends trimmed\n\nsalt\n\npurple or yellow potatoes 4 small\n\nlemon juice 1 tbsp\n\nfreshly ground black pepper\n\nspiced lentils with spring onion 1 amount (see below), plus any additional spice oil left over from the recipe\n\nsustainable oil-packed tuna 185g, drained\n\nradishes 4, chopped or sliced\n\nmixed herbs 15g, such as dill, coriander, tarragon and/or flat-leaf parsley\n\nlemons 2, halved\n\nFor the spiced lentils with spring onion\n\nblack beluga, puy or French green lentils 200g\n\nsalt\n\nolive oil 125ml\n\ngarlic 4 cloves, thinly sliced\n\ncrushed chilli flakes \u00bd tsp\n\ncoriander seeds 2 tsp, crushed\n\nfennel seeds 1\u00bd tsp, crushed\n\ncumin seeds 1 tsp, crushed\n\nlemon 1\n\nspring onions 6 small, cut into 5cm pieces\n\nfreshly ground black pepper\n\nTo make the spiced lentils, cook the lentils in a large saucepan of salted water until just cooked through, 20-30 minutes. Drain and set aside.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small saucepan, over the lowest heat, combine the olive oil with the garlic and chilli flakes, and the coriander, fennel and cumin seeds. Let the oil and spices cook until the oil is fragrant and the garlic begins to brown, 15-20 minutes. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the lemon and add it to the pan, along with the spring onions; cook for another 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.\n\nToss the lentils with 60ml of the spiced oil - no need to strain; I like the texture and crunchy bits from the seeds and spices. Season with salt and pepper. Halve the lemon and squeeze it through a strainer (to remove seeds) over the lentils, before serving with the additional oil alongside.\n\nFor the salad, prepare a bowl of iced water.\n\nBring a small saucepan of water to the boil. Gently lower in the eggs and boil gently for 6 minutes. Transfer the eggs to the bowl of iced water and let them cool completely.\n\nBlanch the green beans in a saucepan of salted boiling water until bright green and just tender, about 4 minutes.\n\nBring 5cm of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Place a steamer basket inside and steam the potatoes until totally tender, 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let them cool slightly before halving or quartering them, depending on their size.\n\nToss the potatoes, green beans and lemon juice together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.\n\nSpoon the spiced lentils into a large bowl and top with the green beans and potatoes, tuna, radishes and herbs. Gently peel the eggs and cut them in half lengthways, then nestle them in there. Squeeze lemon juice over the top and serve any extra spiced oil alongside.\n\nDo ahead:\n\nThe spiced lentils can be made 5 days ahead and refrigerated.\n\nCrispy chicken legs with rosemary, tiny potatoes and sour cream\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that covering something in fat to slow cook it (AKA \"making a confit\") is only worthy of some glorious game bird like duck or goose. But guess what, this isn't 1778, and I think even Thursday-night chicken deserves this kind of treatment. It's pretty much the most hands-off technique that will yield the most showstopping results.\n\nSomething to note is that while, yes, the chicken gets crazy, fall-apart tender and the crisped skin rivals even the best fried chicken, something else happens here that makes this worth cooking and justifies the amount of olive oil called for. As the chicken slowly cooks, the fat melts into the oil and infuses with the garlic and rosemary, leaving you with something so delicious that it is basically worth its weight in gold.\n\nAfter straining the oil, I stash it in the fridge (it'll keep for about a month) and use it to roast vegetables, crisp up potatoes, saut\u00e9 greens - and, maybe in the most genius way possible, use it to fry my morning eggs.\n\nServes 4\n\nchicken legs 4 (the drumstick and thigh should be attached)\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nwaxy potatoes 350g very small\n\ngarlic 1 bulb, sliced crossways\n\nrosemary 4 sprigs\n\nolive oil 375ml\n\nchives 15g, finely chopped\n\nsour cream 125g\n\nPreheat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3.\n\nSeason the chicken with salt and pepper. Place it in a large baking dish with the potatoes, garlic and rosemary. Cover the whole thing with all the olive oil and bake for 1\u00bd-2 hours, until the chicken is basically falling apart and the garlic is golden brown. Remove the baking dish from the oven and let the chicken cool slightly.\n\nYou can serve the chicken straight from the baking dish, without crisping up the skin, but if you have about 15 minutes and a frying pan, I highly recommend adding in the next step.\n\nScoop out 2 tablespoons of the mixed oil and rendered chicken fat from the baking dish and place it in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Carefully remove 2 chicken legs from the baking dish and place them, skin side down, in the skillet. Cook for 5-8 minutes, until the skin is browned and crisp.\n\nReturn the chicken legs to the baking dish, crispy-skin-side up. Repeat with the remaining 2 chicken legs.\n\nSprinkle the chives over the sour cream and serve it alongside the chicken.\n\nRaw and roasted carrots and fennel with feta and pistachios\n\nThis salad is a good exercise in the magic that can occur when you treat one ingredient very differently - in this case, raw and roasted. It's doing a lot with a little; caramelised, tender bits of carrots and fennel mingle with slices of their raw, crunchy former selves. This salad is also terrific at room temperature and is easily doubled, making it great for feeding a crowd, so feel free to show off this little number at your next party.\n\nServes 4\n\nfennel bulb 1 large, halved lengthways\n\ncarrots 6-8 smallish (preferably with their tops)\n\nspring onions 8, halved crossways\n\nolive oil 5 tbsp\n\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nlemon juice 2 tbsp, plus more as needed\n\ncoriander stems and leaves 30g\n\nfeta 90g, thinly sliced (if it crumbles a bit, that's fine)\n\npistachio nuts 30g, toasted and chopped\n\nPreheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Slice half the fennel into 1cm-thick wedges and place them on a rimmed baking tray.\n\nIf your carrots have tops, remove and set them aside. Scrub the carrots (no need to peel) and place half of them on the baking tray with the fennel. Add half of the spring onions and toss with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and roast, tossing occasionally, until the carrots and fennel are browned and the spring onion begins to char (20-25 minutes). Remove them from the oven and let cool to room temperature.\n\nMeanwhile, thinly slice the remaining carrots and fennel lengthways and place them in a large bowl. Thinly slice the remaining spring onions on a strong bias and add to the bowl with the vegetables.\n\nOnce the roasted vegetables have cooled, add them to the bowl of raw vegetables. Toss with the lemon juice, coriander and some chopped carrot tops, if you've got them (if not, use more coriander, parsley, dill or mint - whatever you have). Season with salt, pepper and more lemon juice, if you like.\n\nDrizzle with the remaining 2 tbsp olive oil and top with the feta and pistachios.\n\nDo ahead:\n\nThis dish, without pistachios and feta, can be made 5 hours ahead; no need to reheat. Add the feta and pistachios when ready to serve.\n\nCold soba with cucumber, watercress and sesame\n\nSoba are one of the few noodles that are actually better cold than hot, in my opinion. They don't have that gummy, starchy thing happening, and they stay soft and wonderful, even after a sleepover in your fridge. I eat this salty, refreshing dish most often on hot summer days, when the thought of consuming anything warmer than the ambient temperature is out of the question.\n\nYuzu kosho is one of those speciality ingredients that you'll likely have to order on the internet. A Japanese paste made from fermented chillies, yuzu (a citrus fruit, a more fragrant version of both lemon and lime) and salt, it has a really unique yet vaguely familiar fermented, spicy, bright citrus flavour that makes it taste good with nearly anything (especially vinaigrettes and slaws). Thicker than hot sauce and not as spicy as sambal, a little yuzu kosho goes a long way, which may explain why it always comes in such a teeny jar.\n\nServes 4\n\nwhite sesame seeds 40g\n\nsoba noodles 450g\n\nsoy sauce 60ml, plus more as needed\n\ntoasted sesame oil 2 tbsp, plus more as needed\n\nunseasoned rice vinegar 2 tbsp\n\nyuzu kosho 1 tbsp (available online)\n\nwatercress sprigs 60g\n\nspring onions 4, thinly sliced\n\nLebanese (short) cucumbers 2, thinly sliced lengthways\n\ncoriander 15g\n\nlime 1, halved\n\nBring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil.\n\nMeanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes, tossing frequently, until the seeds are evenly golden brown and smell roasted. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.\n\nCook the noodles in the boiling water for about 5 minutes until just done (soba cooks much faster than regular pasta, so keep an eye on it). Drain and rinse under cold water to chill completely.\n\nMeanwhile, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar and yuzu kosho in a small bowl. Finely chop half the watercress and add it to the soy sauce mixture, along with half the spring onion.\n\nToss the soba with the dressing and season with more soy sauce or sesame oil, if you like. Divide the soba between four bowls and top with the cucumber, coriander and sesame seeds, and the remaining watercress and spring onion.\n\nSqueeze lime juice on top before eating.\n\nSplit pea salad\n\nAnyone who's ever driven up or down California's 101 Freeway near San Luis Obispo knows about the restaurant Pea Soup Andersen's. When I lived in Santa Cruz right after high school, I'd eat there on my way to or from Los Angeles, always ordering the split pea soup, because how could you not? Nothing there looks especially good, especially not the split pea soup, but hot damn if it isn't tasty. This recipe has nothing to do with that place, other than it's an obvious homage to split pea soup - one of the most delicious and ugly foods out there.\n\nServes 4\n\ndried green (or yellow) split peas 165g\n\nsalt\n\nshelled fresh peas 235g (or frozen and thawed peas)\n\nslab of thick-cut bacon 225g, cut into 1cm pieces\n\nsmall new potatoes 350g, golf-ball size or smaller, quartered\n\nfreshly ground black pepper\n\nwhite wine vinegar 1 tbsp, plus more as needed\n\nwholegrain mustard 2 tbsp\n\nchives 3 tbsp, roughly chopped\n\nCook the dried peas in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 30-35 minutes, until they're tender but not yet split. Drain and place in a large bowl along with the fresh peas.\n\nCook the bacon in a large frying pan over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, until it is crispy and most of the fat has rendered out. Using a slotted spoon, and leaving the fat in the pan, transfer the bacon to the bowl with the peas.\n\nAdd the potatoes to the frying pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are completely tender and golden brown on all sides. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vinegar and mustard, tossing to coat the potatoes and getting any of those awesome bacony potato bits into the mix.\n\nScrape everything from the pan into the bowl with the peas and add the chives. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine, adding more vinegar if you like your peas on the tangy side (I do).\n\nDo ahead:\n\nThe salad can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you can't find split peas, other legumes or grains such as lentils, spelt or barley also work here.\n\nRhubarb almond galette\n\nToo tart for some, too stringy for others, rhubarb is a vegetable struggling to find its place in a fruit world and, for whatever reason, I can relate to that.\n\nOften just cooked to an indistinguishable mush, I think rhubarb's long, elegant stalks deserve their own show. When baked in a galette, they maintain their lovely shape, showing off that vibrant pink colour for all to admire.\n\nGo for the deepest, reddest stalks you can get your hands on, buy it all, chop it up and freeze it. While defrosted rhubarb isn't spectacular for galettes (it will give off too much liquid as it defrosts), you can make some pretty fantastic jam with it.\n\nServes 8\n\negg 1 large, lightly beaten\n\nplain flour for dusting\n\npiecrust \u00bd quantity (see below)\n\nalmond paste 60g\n\nrhubarb 1.15kg, halved lengthways, then cut crossways into 10-15cm pieces\n\nsugar 110g\n\nvanilla ice-cream 110g (optional)\n\nFor the piecrust\n\nplain flour 185g\n\ncaster sugar 1 tsp\n\nsalt 1 tsp\n\nunsalted butter 140g, cold and chopped\n\napple cider vinegar 2 tsp\n\nPreheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5.\n\nFor the piecrust, in a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar and salt together. Add the butter and toss to coat in the flour mixture. Using your hands, smash the butter between your palms and fingertips, mixing it into the flour, creating long, thin, flaky, floury, buttery bits. Once most of the butter is incorporated and there are no large chunks remaining, dump the flour mixture onto a work surface.\n\nCombine the vinegar with 2 tablespoons of iced water and drizzle it over the flour mixture. Run your fingers through the mixture to evenly distribute the water through the flour until the dough starts coming together.\n\nKnead the dough a few more times, just to gather up any dry bits from the bottom and place them on the top to be incorporated. Once you have a shaggy mass of dough (it will not be smooth and it certainly will not be shiny), knead it once or twice more. Divide the dough into two pieces, and pat each one into a flat disc, about 2.5cm thick. Wrap each one in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\n\nTo make the galette, beat the egg with 1 teaspoon of water and set aside (this is your egg wash).\n\nRoll out one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface to a round 35-40cm in diameter, more or less. Transfer to a baking-paper-lined baking tray.\n\nFlatten large bits of the almond paste between your palms until they are super thin (3-4mm) and place them on top of the dough, leaving a 5cm border. Arrange the rhubarb pieces over the almond paste. Don't worry about placing them in any sort of pattern.\n\nFold the edges of the dough up and over the rhubarb. Brush the edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with the sugar, throwing most of it on top of the rhubarb. (Remember, the almond paste is pretty sweet, so you don't need as much sugar as you think you might.)\n\nPlace the galette in the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown, 50-60 minutes. Let it cool slightly before eating with the best vanilla ice-cream you can find.\n\nDining In by Alison Roman (Hardie Grant, \u00a322). To order a copy for \u00a318.99 go to guardianbookshop.com.

    "body": "Breaking into the NBA Sneaker King Power Rankings at this point in the season is extremely difficult, but a number of big-name players accomplished just that here in Vol. 8. How did they do it? Some took us back to our childhood by rocking classic retro kicks, others continued to show off new colorways of their signature shoes. One player made his way in by lacing up some of the most location-specific custom sneakers we've seen this season.\n\nThe race to make the cut for Vol. 8 was unprecedented and the Just Missed The Cut section is overpopulated like never before. We've been warning you: The competition will only continue to intensify, but that just means we all get blessed with more insane kicks on the court. Let's get to it. Here are the 15 hoopers that have displayed the best shoe game over the past week.\n\n15. Vince Carter (Last week: NR)\n\nThe year is 2046 and the NBA is celebrating its 100th season. Not much else is certain other than Vince Carter dribbling through the lane and rising for a dunk, leaving us in awe of his extreme longevity. Flashback to present day when Carter is playing in his 21st season and is still lacing up kicks that grab our attention. Vinsanity has lately been paying homage to his days back in Toronto, rocking two pairs of the Nike Shox BB4 in Raptors inspired colorways.\n\n14. Langston Galloway (Last week: NR)\n\nPistons guard Langston Galloway has solidified himself as a custom shoe legend this season. His sneaker customizer Andrew Lewis (@andr3wtl on Instagram) deserves a ton of credit for consistently hooking Galloway up with eye-popping designs. His highlights recently include a pair of kicks for International Women's Day that featured the names of women Galloway looks up to. It's hard to outshine those kicks, but the duo teamed up and created a pair of shoes for Galloway's game in Miami against the Heat in a \"Grand Theft Auto Vice City\" flavor that was just too on point. Keep scrolling to check the kicks out.\n\n13. Dwyane Wade (Last week: 10)\n\nHeat legend Dwyane Wade makes his sixth straight appearance in our Sneaker King Power Rankings. Here in Vol. 8, Wade continues to show off new, vibrant colorways from his Li Ning Way of Wade signature line as he pushes to keep the Heat in playoff contention. We probably shouldn't be surprised by Wade's continued success on the hardwood OR his extensive run of insane kicks, but yet here we are week after week.\n\n12. James Harden (Last week: 15)\n\nRockets star guard James Harden is making back-to-back appearances in the Sneaker King Power Rankings. Harden continues to ball out in style as he chases yet another MVP trophy. Harden's run has come in style with a number of crispy colorways of his signature Adidas Harden Vol. 3. His best pair of the last week is featured below in a vibrant Arizona State colorway -- paying homage to his college days -- with a popping teal inside. The Beard is killing the shoe game.\n\n11. Stephen Curry (Last week: NR)\n\nWarriors point guard Stephen Curry continues to revolutionize basketball with his ridiculous shooting touch. What puts Chef Curry over the top is that he does all that in style. Curry is enjoying the success of his signature Under Armour Curry 6 and has been debuting a number of new colorways lately. The biggest highlight of them all came when he broke out an all-purple pair inspired by a young girl who previously reached out to Curry via letter to ask the two-time MVP why his Under Armour kicks weren't available in the girls' section when she was online shopping. Hats off to Curry for linking up with the fan and using that moment as a way to further spread positivity through his footwear. The kicks and message can be seen below along with two more new colorways of the Curry 6.\n\n10. Jayson Tatum (Last week: 9)\n\nCeltics youngin' Jayson Tatum is making consecutive appearances in our NBA Sneaker King Power Rankings. The second-year player out of Duke continues to show off his player-exclusive pair of the Nike Adapt BB, the first ever self-lacing shoe to see the NBA hardwood. Tatum kept the momentum going with one of the better custom kicks we've seen this season when he rocked a pair of Nike Kyrie 4s that payed homage to his hometown (St. Louis), his alma mater (Duke) and the Celtics all at once.\n\n9. Derrick Jones Jr. (Last week: 12)\n\nHeat forward Derrick Jones Jr. makes his third straight Sneaker King Power Rankings appearance. In Vol. 7, we featured Jones Jr. because of his blend of flashy custom kicks and vintage retros. This week, Airplane Mode soared up the rankings with the slickest and most name-appropriate custom shoes we've seen to date. Teaming up with Marcus Rivero (@SolesBySir on Instagram), Jones Jr. broke out a pair of baby blue custom Jordan 11s with his nickname displayed as if it were written as a message in the sky. It just doesn't get any better than that, shout out to Airplane Mode.\n\n8. Tobias Harris (Last week: 8)\n\n76ers forward Tobias Harris is a Sneaker King Power Rankings mainstay, making his sixth straight appearance here in Vol. 8. We've documented Harris' extensive Nike Kobe line collection and his name is one that comes up when you think of active players keeping the Kobe Bryant line alive and well. Harris' highlight this week came when he broke out the timeless Nike Kobe 5 \"Big Stage\" in a matchup against the Pacers.\n\n7. DeMar DeRozan (Last week: 6)\n\nIn Vol. 7 we said this about Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan: If Nike keeps sending you the brand new stuff before anyone else it seems like they consider you the king of the Kobe line. Well, what happened after that was said? Nike sent DeRozan yet another brand new pair of the Nike Kobe 4 Protro to debut. He's the king of the line -- keep scrolling to check the kicks out.\n\n6. Kyrie Irving (Last week: 4)\n\nCeltics point guard Kyrie Irving is on a completely out-of-this-world run when it comes to his signature Nike Kyrie 5 line. The only reason Irving drops two slots from last week's No. 4 spot is simply the competition ahead of him. This week's highlights include the classic Kyrie 5 \"Ikhet Dusk,\" a colorway that has only been made available to friends and family so far. Uncle Drew somehow managed to up that sneaker display and absolutely launched the sneaker community into a frenzy when he broke out something we had yet to see before, the Kyrie 5 \"Oregon\" PE.\n\n5. Paul George (Last week: NR)\n\nA shoulder injury caused Thunder forward Paul George to miss some time at the beginning of March, ending a streak of six consecutive appearances in the Sneaker King Power Rankings. PG-13 is finally back on the court and he's back in the mix contending for the crown here in our rankings. George has been really showing off some player-exclusive kicks from his signature Nike PG 3 line and those really put him over the top this week. Keep scrolling and you'll be blessed with two vibrant, yet smooth colorways of P.G.'s latest sneakers.\n\n4. LeBron James (Last week: 2)\n\nLakers star LeBron James was our feature athlete in last week's edition of the NBA Sneaker King Power Rankings after an incredible run of kicks from his Nike LeBron 16 line. The King somehow kept all that momentum going here in Vol. 8 and is still in the battle for the Sneaker King crown. It's officially the time of year when we're all on LeBron Watch, and since the Lakers seemingly won't be in the playoffs, we're strictly watching to see what shoes he rocks on the court. James had us all buzzing when he broke out the LeBron 16 \"SuperBron,\" the latest in a long tradition of sneakers decorated in Super Man colors. He kept the heat coming when he debuted a new LeBron 16 colorway that honors the classic Nike Air Max 90.\n\n3. Russell Westbrook (Last week: 5)\n\nAs far as showing off new colorways and player-exclusive kicks from a signature line, no one seems to do it at the frequency that Thunder star Russell Westbrook does. The Brodie has been feverishly breaking out new editions of his Jordan Why Not Zer0.2 shoes this week, launching him from No. 5 in last week's rankings into the top 3. Westbrook's highlights are featured below, but one of them in particular stole the show: A plaid pair of kicks that were dubbed the Why Not Zer0.2 \"Fashion King\" PE. It's going to be difficult for Westbrook to keep this pace and continue to unveil multiple new pairs a week, but, then again, no one thought he'd be averaging a triple-double three years in a row.\n\n2. Montrezl Harrell (Last week: 3)\n\nClippers big man Montrezl Harrell made one of the strongest pushes with his on-court footwear over the past week, which is why he moves up one slot from Vol. 7. Harrell continues to put his creativity on display nightly and keeps us all guessing on what sort of custom work he's going to pull off next. This week's highlights include a Jordan 14 custom decorated to honor late, great rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. The customs kept coming with a pair of Jordan 12 kicks that highlighted in college career at Louisville and a pair of Jordan 10's with characters from TV show \"Rocket Power\" featured all over the midsole of the shoe. All the custom work Harrell's rocked this week is featured below, do yourself a favor and keep scrolling.\n\n1. P.J. Tucker (Last week: 1)\n\nRockets guard P.J. Tucker continues to defy the odds and push the limits when it comes to his sneaker game. Tucker is adding to his legend in the sneaker community and knocking him from the top spot --now five weeks in a row -- will have to take an upset the likes of when the Giants stunned the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. This week's run for Tucker has been how it always goes -- we reach a point where we don't think he can surprise us and then he does just that. Tucker's absolute gem of the week came when he unearthed the Nike KD 3 \"HORSE\" sample for a home game against the 76ers. Remember when the NBA brought back the HORSE competition for the All-Star festivities and Kevin Durant won both of them before it was removed? Yeah, Tucker found a sample of the shoes Nike made for K.D. and literally made us all shake our heads in amazement. Tucker's other remarkable highlights this week include the Nike Adapt BB, the Nike LeBron 2 \"Dunkman,\" the Nike KD 4 \"Texas\" PE and the Nike Kobe 6 \"Del Sol.\" This incredible run leaves me to say this to P.J.: Thank you for always humbling the sneaker community and their shoe collections.\n\nJust Missed The Cut\n\nThese are the players that are on the brink of making the jump in the Sneaker King Power Rankings: Suns forward Kelly Oubre Jr., Nuggets guard Malik Beasley, Nuggets guard Isaiah Thomas, Cavaliers guard Jordan Clarkson, Hornets guard Kemba Walker, 76ers swingman Jimmy Butler, Heat guard Josh Richardson and Knicks guard Allonzo Trier.",

    "title": "The Dish: Chef Andy Little",
    "body": "Andy Little grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country where he savored the produce of local farms. After first aiming for a career in classical music, he started supporting himself with restaurant work and grew inspired to become a chef. He headed off to the prestigious Culinary Institute of America and started his career. Five years ago, he became executive chef and partner at Josephine in Nashville where Pennsylvania Dutch and southern hospitality meld together for a unique and much-honored cuisine.\n\n* Truss the chicken and place in brine(see recipe below) for 24 hours. After 24 hours, remove the chicken from the brine, rinse all brine off and place in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 24 hours to dry. Add the peanut oil to a large pot and heat to 350 degrees. Allow enough room for the chicken to raise the oil level and also for the bubbling and splashing that will occur while frying. Once the oil is heated to 350 degrees, place the whole chicken in the oil and fry for 30 minutes while maintaining 350 degrees. Alternatively, if you want to roast the chicken, roast in the oven at 425 degrees for 55 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oil, place on a resting rack and season with chicken spice(see recipe below). Serve with kale salad and fingerling potatoes.\n\n* For the brine: Place the water, salt, honey, bay leaves, garlic, peppercorns, rosemary, thyme, parsley and lemons in a large pot and bring to a simmer. Once at a simmer, remove from the heat and allow to cool completely.\n\n* To char the onions: Drizzle the onions with 1T olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the onions on a hot grill and char until the achieve nice color and are cooked through. Chill in refrigerator.\n\n* Place the chilled charred onions in a blender with the egg yolks, red wine vinegar, honey, garlic, water and thyme. Blend the mixture until smooth and slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n* To finish, bruise the kale by gently squeezing it in your hand then dress the kale with the charred onion vinaigrette until evenly coated and seasoned.\n\n* Place the potatoes, garlic and thyme in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and cook the potatoes until they are just cooked through. Remove the cooked potatoes from the water and place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cool, smash flat and reserve for frying. Once you are ready to complete the dish, heat the peanut oil to 350 degrees and fry the potatoes until crispy and golden brown. Season with salt and pepper then dress with the Worcestershire vinaigrette(method below)\n\n* Combine the Worcestershire sauce, thyme, garlic, honey and egg yolks in a blender. On slow speed, start to blend the mix, when fully blended and smooth, slowly stream the olive oil into the blender to make a vinaigrette.

Once they have achieved a golden brown color, season with salt and pepper and remove to a paper towel and drain the oil out of the pot. With the same pot you just used, add the butter and place over medium to high heat. When the butter is melted, add the onion, celery, garlic and cook over medium heat until translucent, but before the vegetables attain any color. Add the thyme, bay leaf, half and half and potatoes. Cook until the potatoes soften and the half and half is reduced to a pot pie consistency.\n\nFor the pot pie tops:\n\n* Cut butter into flour until it is about the size of peas\n\n* Take the flour in sections, and roll with rolling pin to create flaky pieces of butter\n\n* Slowly incorporate water, mixing and distributing with your finger tips\n\n* Once the water is evenly distributed, bring the dough together by pressing with the palm of your hand.\n\n* Form dough into a square packet, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour up to 1 day\n\n* Using flour as needed, roll dough out into a rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Then fold the dough onto itself in third, just like folding a letter. Roll out dough again to 1/4\" thick. Chill dough 1 hour.\n\n* Blend together 1 egg, 1 yolk, and a pinch of salt to make an egg wash.\n\n* Brush the top of the dough with a thin layer of egg wash\n\n* Cut and score dough to desired shape and size, freeze until ready to bake\n\nBake at 400 F for 20-30 minutes until dark golden across and flaky.\n\n* Film a large heavy bottomed stock pot with oil and place over medium high heat. Add the chicken livers and brown then add garlic and shallot. Continue to cook the vegetables until they are translucent then add the ground pork, thyme, black pepper, salt, sugar and cook until the pork is fully cooked, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, turn the heat off and allow to cool slightly. Process the mixture in a blender until smooth. Once the mixture is finished blending, return to the heavy bottomed stock pot and add fennel seed and red pepper flake. Next, slowly whisk in cornmeal over medium heat, bring to a boil, turn off heat and let mixture sit for 15 minutes. Turn the heat medium-low heat and very slowly add buckwheat flour. Cook for an additional 10 minutes then place in the scrapple mixture in prepared(sprayed with cooking spray) loaf pans and refrigerate over night.\n\n* To serve, cut slices about \u00be\" thick and pan fry in olive oil until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper then coat with Nashville hot sauce and top with frisee lettuce coated with olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper and chives. Place a spoonful of pickled vinaigrette on the plate and place the scrapple on top of the vinaigrette.\n\nPickle vinaigrette:\n\n* Separate the pickles from their brine and add the pickles to a blender.

    "title": "From barley risotto to sorbet: Yotam Ottolenghi's lemon recipes",
    "body": "Those close to me often mock my uninhibited love for the lemon. 'When in doubt,' they say with a big glug of irony, 'add lemon. Zest and juice, a bit of chopped-up flesh and, perhaps, some preserved lemon to round it all off.' I don't take this to heart, though: I acknowledge and embrace my habit. Lemon is a fruit of great wonder. If it didn't exist, someone would invent it and make a killing. What makes it so fantastic is the enchanting aromatic oil in the skin and the fruity-zingy-crisp acidity of the flesh. You just can't beat the magic of those two coming together, and you shouldn't really try. So next time life gives you lemons, forget lemonade and make a cake, risotto, sorbet - or just about any other dish with my name above it.\n\nAmalfi lemon, bay leaf and olive oil cake\n\nThis cake is epically fragrant (thanks to the lemon zest, fresh bay and olive oil) and has the supplest crumb (the ricotta and olive oil take care of that). It keeps for up to three days in a sealed container, and is even better a day after baking.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 1 hr 25 min\n\nServes 8-10\n\n200ml whole milk\n\n150g ricotta\n\n4 Amalfi lemons (or regular lemons), zest finely grated, to get 2\u00bd tbsp, then juiced, to get 3\u00bd tbsp\n\n300g '00' flour\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 tsp baking powder\n\n\u00bd tsp bicarbonate of soda\n\n350g caster sugar, plus 2 tbsp extra for sprinkling\n\n3 fresh bay leaves, roughly chopped\n\n3 large eggs\n\n225ml good-quality olive oil, plus extra for greasing\n\nFor the glaze\n\n100g icing sugar\n\n\u00bd tsp good-quality olive oil\n\n3 fresh bay leaves, roughly chopped, plus a few whole leaves for decorating\n\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/375F/gas 5. Grease a 24cm bundt tin. In a jug, whisk the milk, ricotta and two tablespoons of lemon juice. Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and bicarb into a medium bowl.\n\nPut the caster sugar, chopped bay leaves and two tablespoons of lemon zest into the bowl of a food processor and blitz until the bay is finely chopped. In a free-standing mixer with the whisk attachment in place, beat the eggs and bay leaf sugar on high speed until thick, pale and creamy - about three minutes. Turn the speed down to medium-low and drizzle in the oil in a slow, steady stream, until fully incorporated and homogeneous - about a minute. Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment and, with the speed on medium-low, add the flour and milk mixtures in three increments, starting and ending with the flour. Combine until just incorporated, taking care not to over-mix.\n\nPour the batter into the bundt tin, smooth the top with the back of a spoon and sprinkle over the last two tablespoons of sugar. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown and a knife comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a rack to cool completely.\n\nFor the glaze, put the icing sugar and bay leaves into the bowl of a food processor and blitz until the leaves are very finely chopped. Add the oil and remaining tablespoon and a half of lemon juice, and blitz again until smooth. Use a spoon to drizzle the glaze all over the cake, letting some of it run down the sides. Sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon and a half of zest and top with a few bay leaves.\n\nBarley risotto with lemon, spinach and spicy breadcrumbs\n\nNutty barley and spicy breadcrumbs give this more texture and a deeper flavour than you might expect, with a spoonful of creme fraiche to bring it all together.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nCook 1 hr 25 min\n\nServes 4\n\n3\u00bd tbsp olive oil\n\n30g panko breadcrumbs\n\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n\u2153 tsp chilli flakes\n\n1\u00bd tbsp parsley leaves, roughly chopped\n\n1-2 lemons, finely grate the zest, to get 2 tsp, and juice, to get 1 tbsp\n\n1 litre chicken or vegetable stock\n\n1 onion, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 tbsp thyme leaves, roughly chopped\n\n220g pearl barley\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n75ml dry white wine\n\n200g baby spinach\n\n50g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve, if you like\n\n50g creme fraiche\n\n1 handful basil leaves, to garnish\n\nPut a tablespoon and a half of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat. Add the panko and half the garlic, and cook, stirring, for about seven minutes, or until they start to colour. Add the chilli, parsley and lemon zest, and cook for four minutes, stirring continuously, until the crumbs are golden, then transfer to a plate to cool.\n\nBring the stock and 500ml water to a simmer in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat, and keep warm on a low heat while you make the risotto.\n\nPut the last two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and sweat, stirring occasionally, for about six minutes, or until softened but not browned. Add the thyme and remaining garlic, cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant, then stir in the barley, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for 90 seconds, until the grains are very hot. Add the wine, and cook until almost completely reduced - about 30 seconds - then ladle in 200ml of hot stock. Turn the heat down to medium and let the stock bubble away, stirring often, until absorbed but not completely reduced. Repeat, adding a ladle or two of stock at a time and stirring often, much as you would a risotto, until all the stock is absorbed and the barley cooked - about 45-50 minutes in total.\n\nAdd the spinach in batches, until just wilted, then add the cheese, creme fraiche and lemon juice. Divide the risotto between four shallow bowls, top with the breadcrumbs, basil and extra parmesan, if using, and serve.\n\nLemon and hibiscus sorbet (main picture)\n\nSome may think this a little garish - the sorbet is such a bright shade of pink - but I think it's fun. My son Max proclaimed it the best dessert ever, \"better than custard\". If you don't have an ice-cream machine, pour the mix into a plastic container and freeze, breaking up the crystals with a fork every now and then. Serves eightAnd by all means set it in a regular container if you don't want to carve out lemons.\n\nPrep 3 min\n\nCook 40 min\n\nChurn 25 min\n\nFreeze 4 hr\n\nServes 8\n\n8 large unwaxed lemons\n\n200g caster sugar\n\n10g dried hibiscus flowers\n\n300ml water\n\n2 tbsp fresh mint, stalks and leaves\n\nCut the top third off each lemon, then juice both parts to give you 350g of juice and pulp combined. Use a spoon to hollow out the lemons (discard the flesh, seeds and pith) - don't worry if you can't get it all out, and take care not to pierce the skin. Shave a little off the base of each lemon, so they sit straight (again, don't puncture them), then arrange cut side up in a tray, so they're snug and balanced. Put the lids on a separate tray, then freeze both while you get on with making the sorbet.\n\nPut the reserved juice and pulp in a medium saucepan with the sugar, hibiscus and water. Bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat, and cook for six minutes, stirring from time to time, until the sugar melts. Off the heat, add the mint and steep for 15 minutes - the liquid will go very pink.\n\nStrain through a sieve into a wide container, discard the aromatics and refrigerate until chilled. Pour the liquid into an ice-cream machine and churn for 25 minutes, until frozen and smooth, then transfer to a piping bag and seal. Freeze for two to three hours, until firm, crushing the bag with your hands a few times to break up the ice crystals.\n\nRemove the hollowed lemons from the freezer. Cut the tip of the piping bag to create a 2-3cm-wide opening, then pipe the sorbet into the lemons, so it comes about 5mm above the rim. Top with the lids and press down so they stick. Return to the freezer for at least an hour before serving.",

    "title": "Cool 'March' to continue, hints forecast of IMD - Times of India",
    "body": "PUNE: This March could end on a cool note.\n\nMost parts of the country saw cooler than normal temperatures in the first 15 days of the month. The upcoming week, and probably the next fortnight, is likely to be no different.\n\nThe second fortnight of March is likely to be cooler than normal in major parts of India, as per the latest extended range forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Met department said the forecast flow patterns and temperature anomalies suggest that no major \"heat wave situation\" was likely to develop over India during the next two-week period, beginning Friday.\n\nA caveat would not be out of place, though. The extended range forecast is generally accurate up to the first week of the forecast period.\n\nThe forecast said cooler than normal day temperature was likely over major parts of northwest, central and western parts of the country. Coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh, interior Odisha, interior Tamil Nadu, north Kerala, interior Karnataka, Konkan, Goa and Gujarat may experience above-normal day temperature (2-3 degrees more than the climatological average) on most of the days except during March 20-23, when it could fall to the near-normal range.\n\nThe extended range forecast said the night temperature was also likely to remain below normal by 2-4 degrees over major parts of India during the next two weeks. There could be brief periods of warmer than normal nights in scattered pockets comprising Karnataka, Rayalaseema and interior Maharashtra.\n\nAn IMD official told TOI that as per the extended range forecast, cooler than normal day temperature was likely over major parts of northwest, central and western parts of the country, but it might still be summer-like. \"Western disturbances are continuing to affect the country this month too, keeping the day temperature normal to slightly below normal in parts of the country,\" he said.\n\nHe said large-scale factors and local conditions in some regions were currently keeping a major heat wave spell at bay.\n\nMedium range forecasts also suggest that 'near-heat-wave-like conditions' may develop in isolated parts of south Maharashtra (including parts of Vidarbha) and south peninsula India, but a major heat wave can be ruled out during the next five days.\n\nAnupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, said there seem to be no chance of heat wave conditions in north Madhya Maharashtra, extreme western parts of Vidarbha, north Marathwada and north Konkan and Goa during the next five days.\n\n\"South Maharashtra (including parts of Vidarbha) may see a gradual rise in day temperature around March 17 to 19 and witness 'near-heat-wave' conditions, but not an actual heat wave. After that, another strong western disturbance is approaching. It will show its impact around March 21, causing moisture feeding and slight fall in the day temperature. Thus, chances of maximum temperature reaching a heat wave condition are minimum in central India, including Maharashtra, for some time,\" Kashyapi said.",

    "body": "* Romy Gill is a food writer and chef/owner of Romy's Kitchen in Thornbury, near Bristol.\n\nPanch phoron aloo (pictured above)\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 15-20 min\n\nServes 4\n\n6 tsp sunflower oil\n\n2 tsp panch phoron - this is a traditional spice mix made with equal quantities of fennel, nigella, cumin, fenugreek and black mustard seeds, all ground together\n\n1\u00bd tsp red chilli flakes\n\n1 tsp ground turmeric\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n500g potatoes, peeled and cut into 1\u00bdcm dice\n\n20ml water\n\nPut the oil in a wide pan on a medium heat and, once hot, add the panch phoron, chilli flakes, turmeric and salt, and cook, stirring, for a minute.\n\nAdd the diced potatoes and water, stir to coat in the spice mix, then cover the pan and leave to cook for 10-12 minutes on a low heat - the moisture in the sealed pan will cook the potatoes.\n\nServe with roti, wraps or even inside a toastie.\n\nAloo paratha\n\nPrep 10-15 min\n\nRest 30 min\n\nCook 45 min\n\nMakes 4 small paratha\n\nFor the paratha\n\n50g wholemeal flour\n\n50g plain flour, plus extra for dusting\n\nSalt\n\n55-70ml cold water\n\n1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for frying\n\nFor the filling\n\n3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into even chunks\n\n1 tsp grated ginger\n\n20g raw beetroot, grated\n\n2 green chillies, finely chopped (deseeded if you prefer less heat)\n\n2 tsp chopped coriander\n\n1 tsp ground coriander\n\n1 tsp ground cumin\n\n1 tsp salt\n\nBoil the potatoes in salted water for about 10 minutes, until cooked through, then drain and mash. Transfer to a bowl, add the ginger, beetroot, chillies, spices and salt, and mix to combine.\n\nPut both the flours in a large bowl, pour in 55ml cold water and half a teaspoon of salt, and mix with your hands to a dough - if it feels a little dry, add more water. Knead for five minutes, until smooth and elastic - add the tablespoon of oil to help this along - then cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for half an hour.\n\nDivide the dough into four, roll each piece into a ball, then, on a floured surface, roll into a 2mm-thick disc (flour the rolling pin, too). Take one disc and top with a tablespoon of filling. Bring the disc's edges into the centre, pinch to seal and form a pouch, then flatten the pouch in your hands. Sprinkle with more flour and roll again, seam side down, to 2mm thick. Repeat with the remaining three balls.\n\nPut a frying pan on a medium heat, then dry-fry the parathas in batches on one side for a minute. Flip and cook for a minute more, until small blisters appear on the surface. Brush oil on both sides of the paratha, flip over again and fry for one to two minutes, until crisp. Keep warm while you cook the remaining parathas. Serve with raita and pickles or chutneys.\n\nAloo tikki\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nChill 20 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 4 as a starter\n\n220g potatoes, peeled and cut into even chunks\n\n170g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into even chunks\n\n1 tsp chilli flakes\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n10g chives\n\n15g gram flour (ie, chickpea flour)\n\n200ml sunflower oil, for shallow frying\n\nPut the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a large pot of salted water, bring to a boil, cook for 10 minutes, then drain and transfer to a large bowl. Leave them to cool down, then tip in the chilli flakes, salt, chives and gram flour, and mash - I do this with my hands, crushing everything together, but you could also use a masher or, for a smoother result, a potato ricer.\n\nWith your hands, form eight balls from the potato mix, each weighing around 45g. Flatten the balls a little, so they look like patties, put on a plate and refrigerate for 20 minutes to firm up.\n\nHeat the oil in a pan on a medium flame, then shallow fry the tikki one or two at a time, until crisp and evenly browned all over - about four or five minutes a side. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen towel, to drain, and keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the remaining tikki.\n\nServe hot with a simple lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad (or some chickpeas, for a more substantial dish) and chutneys (though my daughters love them with ketchup).\n\nAloo methi\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 35 min\n\nServes 4\n\n6 tsp sunflower oil\n\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n\n2 medium red onions, peeled and sliced very thin\n\n2 green chillies, finely chopped (deseeded if you prefer less heat)\n\n1 tsp ground turmeric\n\n2 tsp garam masala\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n340g potatoes, peeled and cut into 1cm dice\n\n100g fresh fenugreek leaves, washed and chopped (if you can't find fenugreek, use green kale instead)\n\n15ml water\n\nPut the oil in a pan on a medium heat and, once hot, add the cumin seeds and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, then stir in the chillies, turmeric, garam masala and salt, and cook for a minute longer.\n\nAdd the diced potatoes, fenugreek and water, stir to coat, then cover the pan, turn the heat to low, and leave to cook for 20 minutes.\n\nServe with roti, wraps or pitta cut in half to make pockets for stuffing with the aloo methi.\n\n* Romy Gill is chef/owner of Romy's Kitchen in Thornbury, near Bristol.

    "title": "NBA scores, highlights, results: James Harden drops 41 points as Rockets beat Suns; Giannis leads Bucks past Heat",
    "body": "An eight-game slate made up the NBA schedule for Friday night.\n\nThe night began with the Lakers falling further out of the playoff picture with a loss to the Pistons, as LeBron James sat out due to rest. One of the other early highlights on the night was the Hornets outlasting the Wizards despite Bradley Beal's 40 points.\n\nOne of the evening's best battles occurred in Miami, where two playoff teams in the Eastern Conference went head-to-head when the Heat hosted the Milwaukee Bucks. The Heat got off to a huge lead, but the Bucks came storming back to firmly take control in the fourth quarter and pull out the road win.\n\nElsewhere, the Clippers used a 45-point third quarter to take care of the Chicago Bulls at the Staples Center. Here's everything you need to know about Friday's action, along with Saturday's schedule.\n\nNBA scores for Friday, March 15 Charlotte Hornets 116, Washington Wizards 110 (Box Score)\n\nDetroit Pistons 111, Los Angeles Lakers 97 (Box Score)\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers 123, Sacramento Kings 114 (Box Score)\n\nPortland Trail Blazers 122, New Orleans Pelicans, 110 (Box Score)Milwaukee Bucks 113, Miami Heat 98 (Box Score) Houston Rockets 108, Phoenix Suns 102 (Box Score)San Antonio Spurs 109, New York Knicks 83 (Box Score)Los Angeles Clippers 128, Chicago Bulls 121 (Box Score) NBA schedule for Saturday, March 16\n\n*All times Eastern\n\nAtlanta Hawks at Boston Celtics, 12:30 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionMemphis Grizzlies at Washington Wizards, 7 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionPhoenix Suns at New Orleans Pelicans, 7 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionCleveland Cavaliers at Dallas Mavericks, 8:30 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionGolden State Warriors at Oklahoma City Thunder, 8:30 p.m. (GameTracker) -- TV: ABCPortland Trail Blazers at San Antonio Spurs, 8:30 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionIndiana Pacers at Denver Nuggets, 9 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extensionBrooklyn Nets at Utah Jazz, 9 p.m. (GameTracker) -- Watch on fuboTV with NBA League Pass extension Rivers, Boylen earn simultaneous ejections\n\nWe've seen games in which both coaches get ejected, but we rarely see them get ejected at the exact same time. Clippers coach Doc Rivers and Bulls coach Jim Boylen exchanged words late in the third quarter on Friday night, and both were sent to the showers early.\n\nHarden has big night for Rockets\n\nWith Chris Paul out, James Harden expectedly took on the offensive load for the Rockets in a close win over the Suns. The Beard notched 41 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds, six steals and three blocks to continue the quest for a second straight MVP.\n\nGiannis takes over in Bucks win\n\nThe league-leading Bucks looked to be having an off night in Miami, but Giannis Antetokounmpo would have none of that. He took over down the stretch to lead a massive Bucks comeback, and finished the night with 33 points, 16 rebounds, nine assists, three blocks and two steals.\n\nRandle, Payton have career nights for Pels\n\nThe Pelicans may have lost to the Blazers, but Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton had nights to remember. Randle scored a career-high 45 points on 20-of-34 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds and six assists.\n\nMeanwhile Payton dished out a career-best 16 assists with 14 points and 12 rebounds. He became the first player in Pelicans history to record three straight triple-doubles, and the only player besides Russell Westbrook to accomplish the feat this season.\n\nWade throws it up, Winslow throws it down\n\nJustise Winslow is left-handed, but he had no problem throwing down a right-handed slam off this alley-oop from Dwyane Wade.\n\nCaldwell-Pope slams it over his former team\n\nThe Lakers aren't making the playoffs this season, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope managed to dunk it over his former team, the Pistons.\n\nWinslow gets chase-down block on Brogdon\n\nThis isn't quite LeBron James on Andre Iguodala, but check out this chase-down block by Justise Winslow on Malcolm Brogdon during Friday's game between the Heat and Bucks.\n\nRandle scores 21 points in first quarter\n\nJulius Randle is obviously the top scoring option without Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday in the lineup. The young forward scored 21 points in the opening frame against the Blazers, the most he's ever scored in a single quarter.\n\nBoban to Tobias for an easy slam\n\nBoban Marjanovic isn't exactly known for being a passer, but he'll take this highlight after he hooked up Tobias Harris for an easy slam.\n\nBlake tricks Lakers with handle\n\nThe Lakers thought this was a pass ... and well, it wasn't. Blake Griffin managed to trick the Lakers defenders with his handle before nailing the 3-point attempt.\n\nEmbiid with no regard for human life\n\nJoel Embiid talks a lot of trash, but he does back it up from time to time. He did so on this dunk highlight over the Kings' Bogdan Bogdanovic.",

    "body": "MIAMI -- Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, and the Milwaukee Bucks rallied from a 20-point halftime deficit to beat the Miami Heat 113-98 on Friday night.\n\nAntetokounmpo also had 16 rebounds and nine assists for the Bucks, who became the first team in NBA history to trail by at least 20 points at the half and win by more than 11. Khris Middleton scored 21 and Eric Bledsoe had 17 for the NBA-best Bucks, who improved to 52-17.\n\nMilwaukee outscored Miami 71-36 in the second half.\n\nIt matched the biggest halftime deficit overcome for a win in Bucks history -- they were down 72-52 at the break against the New York Knicks on Feb. 18, 1977, and won 124-123. They were 0-100 in all other instances, 0-77 on the road.\n\nJustise Winslow had all of his 20 points in the first half for Miami, which had its lead over Orlando and Charlotte for the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference trimmed to just one game. Hassan Whiteside had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, Josh Richardson scored 11 points and Dwyane Wade was one of four players with 10 for Miami.\n\nAntetokounmpo was in total control of the second half, grabbing an offensive rebound with 2:40 left and throwing a no-look, behind-the-head pass to Bledsoe for a layup and a 110-92 lead. Most fans didn't see it -- they were long gone by then.\n\nThe Bucks lost Malcolm Brogdon in the first quarter to a sore right heel. Brogdon was 0 for 3 in 6 1/2 minutes.\n\nThe rally from 23 down was the Bucks' biggest of the season, one better than what they did against Chicago on Nov 16. It was only the fifth game all season where the Bucks trailed by 20 or more, and they're now 2-3 in those games.\n\nMiami's lead was 62-42 at the half, and everything was working.\n\nAnd then, nothing worked.\n\nThe Heat came out flying, leading 25-8 before any of the starters came out for their first rest of the night. The biggest lead was 37-14 with a minute to go in the opening quarter, and the Bucks pared that down to 13 on three occasions in the second quarter. Miami wound up closing the half on a 10-3 spurt to push the lead back to 20.\n\nIt all changed -- and fast.\n\nThe Bucks made as many 3-pointers in the third quarter -- five -- as the Heat made field goals. Middleton and Ersan Ilyasova each had 10 points in the quarter, Miami shot 5 for 20 and got outrebounded 16-8, and the lead was down to one going into the fourth.",

    "body": "An eight-game slate makes up the NBA's schedule for Friday night.\n\nThe night began with the Lakers falling further out of the playoff picture with a loss to the Pistons, as LeBron James sat out due to rest.\n\nOne of the other early highlights on the night were the Hornets outlasting the Wizards despite Bradley Beal's 40 points.\n\nOne of the evening's best battles occurred in Miami, where two playoff teams in the Eastern Conference went head-to-head when the Heat hosted the Milwaukee Bucks. The Heat got off to a huge lead, but the Bucks came storming back to firmly take control in the fourth quarter and pull out the road win.\n\nElsewhere, the Clippers will host the lottery-bound Chicago Bulls at the Staples Center. The game doesn't have much significance for the Bulls, who are well outside of the playoff picture in the East, but for the Clippers it is extremely important, as they look to hold onto the final playoff spot in the ultra-competitive Western Conference.\n\nNBA scores for Friday, March 15\n\n*All times Eastern\n\nCharlotte Hornets 116, Washington Wizards 110 (Box Score)\n\nDetroit Pistons 111, Los Angeles Lakers 97 (Box Score)\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers 123, Sacramento Kings 114 (Box Score)\n\nPortland Trail Blazers 122, New Orleans Pelicans, 110 (Box Score)Milwaukee Bucks 113, Miami Heat 98 (Box Score) Houston Rockets 108, Phoenix Suns 102 (Box Score)San Antonio Spurs 109, New York Knicks 83 (Box Score)Chicago Bulls at Los Angeles Clippers, 10:30 p.m. (GameTracker) -- TV: NBA TV Streaming: fuboTV (try it free) Harden has big night for Rockets\n\nWith Chris Paul out, James Harden expectedly took on the offensive load for the Rockets in a close win over the Suns. The Beard notched 41 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds, six steals and three blocks to continue the quest for a second straight MVP.\n\nGiannis takes over in Bucks win\n\nThe league-leading Bucks looked to be having an off night in Miami, but Giannis Antetokounmpo would have none of that. He took over down the stretch to lead a massive Bucks comeback, and finished the night with 33 points, 16 rebounds, nine assists, three blocks and two steals.\n\nRandle, Payton have career nights for Pels\n\nThe Pelicans may have lost to the Blazers, but Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton had nights to remember. Randle scored a career-high 45 points on 20-of-34 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds and six assists.\n\nMeanwhile Payton dished out a career-best 16 assists with 14 points and 12 rebounds. He became the first player in Pelicans history to record three straight triple-doubles, and the only player besides Russell Westbrook to accomplish the feat this season.\n\nWade throws it up, Winslow throws it down\n\nJustise Winslow is left-handed, but he had no problem throwing down a right-handed slam off this alley-oop from Dwyane Wade.\n\nCaldwell-Pope slams it over his former team\n\nThe Lakers aren't making the playoffs this season, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope managed to dunk it over his former team, the Pistons.\n\nWinslow gets chase-down block on Brogdon\n\nThis isn't quite LeBron James on Andre Iguodala, but check out this chase-down block by Justise Winslow on Malcolm Brogdon during Friday's game between the Heat and Bucks.\n\nRandle scores 21 points in first quarter\n\nJulius Randle is obviously the top scoring option without Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday in the lineup. The young forward scored 21 points in the opening frame against the Blazers, the most he's ever scored in a single quarter.\n\nBoban to Tobias for an easy slam\n\nBoban Marjanovic isn't exactly known for being a passer, but he'll take this highlight after he hooked up Tobias Harris for an easy slam.\n\nBlake tricks Lakers with handle\n\nThe Lakers thought this was a pass ... and well, it wasn't. Blake Griffin managed to trick the Lakers defenders with his handle before nailing the 3-point attempt.\n\nEmbiid with no regard for human life\n\nJoel Embiid talks a lot of trash, but he does back it up from time to time. He did so on this dunk highlight over the Kings' Bogdan Bogdanovic.",

    "body": "The Milwaukee Bucks overcame a 23-point first-quarter deficit to rally past the host Miami Heat 113-98 on Friday night.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo tallied 33 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists, giving him his 49th double-double. Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe had 21 and 17 points, respectively, for the Bucks, who top the NBA with 52 wins, including 25 on the road.\n\nThe Bucks outscored the Heat 71-36 in the second half to seize control of the game, and Milwaukee won its league-best 16th game when trailing by more than 10 points in a game this season.\n\nJustise Winslow scored 20 -- all in the first half -- and Hassan Whiteside had 14. Josh Richardson scored 11, while Dwyane Wade, Bam Adebayo and Dion Waiters each had 10 for the Heat, who have won six of their past nine.\n\nThe loss left Miami just one game ahead of the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe early pace seemingly would have favored the Bucks, the NBA's second-highest scoring team at 117.6 points per game, but Miami made eight of its first 11 shots to grab a 20-8 edge at the 6:45 mark. Winslow's second 3-pointer and Adebayo's short jumper made it 25-8 with 4:44 left.\n\nA slick layup by Wade, who was a game-time decision to play despite an elbow injury, Winslow's third trey and Goran Dragic's tricky layup helped propel the Heat to a 37-19 lead after one quarter.\n\nMiddleton helped the Bucks cut the lead to 49-36 midway through the second, and Antetokounmpo chipped in as well as the duo combined for 26 points in the half.\n\nHowever, defensive pressure sent the Heat on a 10-2 run, and Winslow's 20 points marked the best half of his four-year career as Miami led 62-42 at halftime -- the Bucks' largest deficit at the break this season.\n\nMilwaukee starting point guard Malcolm Brogdon (right heel soreness) played just six minutes and did not return.\n\nMiddleton and Ersan Ilyasova stepped up their game as the Bucks outscored Miami 37-18 in the third quarter to trim the deficit to 80-79, and both Winslow and Wade had lengthy stints in the Heat locker room.\n\nThe Bucks gained control in the fourth quarter as the Heat struggled to find offense, outscoring Miami 34-18.",

    "body": "By Tim Reynolds\u2009|\u2009AP March 15 at 10:38 PM\n\nMIAMI -- Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points, and the Milwaukee Bucks rallied from a 20-point halftime deficit to beat the Miami Heat 113-98 on Friday night.\n\nAntetokounmpo also had 16 rebounds and nine assists for the Bucks, who became the first team in NBA history to trail by at least 20 points at the half and win by more than 11. Khris Middleton scored 21 and Eric Bledsoe had 17 for the NBA-best Bucks, who improved to 52-17.\n\nMilwaukee outscored Miami 71-36 in the second half.\n\nIt matched the biggest halftime deficit overcome for a win in Bucks history -- they were down 72-52 at the break against the New York Knicks on Feb. 18, 1977, and won 124-123. They were 0-100 in all other instances, 0-77 on the road.\n\nJustise Winslow had all of his 20 points in the first half for Miami, which had its lead over Orlando and Charlotte for the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference trimmed to just one game. Hassan Whiteside had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Heat, Josh Richardson scored 11 points and Dwyane Wade was one of four players with 10 for Miami.\n\nAntetokounmpo was in total control of the second half, grabbing an offensive rebound with 2:40 left and throwing a no-look, behind-the-head pass to Bledsoe for a layup and a 110-92 lead. Most fans didn't see it -- they were long gone by then.\n\nMiami Heat guard Josh Richardson (0) shoots next to Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Friday, March 15, 2019, in Miami. (Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press)\n\nThe Bucks lost Malcolm Brogdon in the first quarter to a sore right heel. Brogdon was 0 for 3 in 6 1/2 minutes.\n\nThe rally from 23 down was the Bucks' biggest of the season, one better than what they did against Chicago on Nov 16. It was only the fifth game all season where the Bucks trailed by 20 or more, and they're now 2-3 in those games.\n\nMiami's lead was 62-42 at the half, and everything was working.\n\nAnd then, nothing worked.\n\nThe Heat came out flying, leading 25-8 before any of the starters came out for their first rest of the night. The biggest lead was 37-14 with a minute to go in the opening quarter, and the Bucks pared that down to 13 on three occasions in the second quarter. Miami wound up closing the half on a 10-3 spurt to push the lead back to 20.\n\nIt all changed -- and fast.\n\nThe Bucks made as many 3-pointers in the third quarter -- five -- as the Heat made field goals. Middleton and Ersan Ilyasova each had 10 points in the quarter, Miami shot 5 for 20 and got outrebounded 16-8, and the lead was down to one going into the fourth.\n\nWade got hurt late in the third quarter, grabbing at his right hip. He went to the locker room, returned midway through the fourth and by then the Bucks were up by 10.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBucks: The 20-point halftime deficit was Milwaukee's largest of the season. The Bucks trailed Chicago by 18 at the break on Nov. 16 -- then outscored the Bulls 78-41 in the second half and won easily. ... George Hill returned after a nine-game absence with an adductor strain. He had to start the second half with Brogdon out.\n\nHeat: It was the fourth time in franchise history that Miami lost when leading by 20 or more at the half. The Heat had been 51-0 all-time at home and 71-3 all-time overall with that big a lead at the break. ... Miami signed guard Charles Cooke to a 10-day contract before the game. Cooke has been with the team's G League affiliate in Sioux Falls.\n\nCLOSING IN\n\nBucks center Brook Lopez was 0 for 1 from 3-point range. He's now up to 436 3s attempted in the 2018-19 campaign, three shy of matching Channing Frye's mark for the most ever by a 7-footer in a season. Frye tried 439 in 2010-11.\n\nONLY ONE\n\nMiami was bidding to become the second team this season to beat Milwaukee twice. Only Phoenix has managed to do that so far in 2018-19.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBucks: Host Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nHeat: Host Charlotte on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

As the Pelicans prepare for a home matchup versus the Blazers, the All-Star big man will sit out tonight's game. The last time Davis sat out a game was versus the Toronto Raptors last Friday night.\n\nLeBron James doesn't play vs. Pistons\n\nFans in Detroit who were hoping to see Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James play in person on Friday night will be disappointed, as James has been ruled out of the contest for \"load management.\" James has seen his playing time decrease since the Lakers fell well outside of the playoff picture in the West, and as the Lakers played in Toronto last night, the team decided to give James the night off on Friday.",

    "body": "The study, published in the European Heart Journal, looked at more than 27,000 heart attack patients between 1987 and 2014.\n\nThe average age of the patients studied was around 63 and 73 per cent were men. About 13,000 heart attacks ended in the death of the patient.\n\nThe individual heart attacks were compared with meteorological data on the day of the attack and adjusted for a range of additional factors, such as the day of the week and socioeconomic status.\n\n\"Over a period of 28 years, we found that there has been an increase in heat-induced heart attack risk in recent years,\" said Kai Chen, a researcher at Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen in Germany.\n\nThe researchers compared data from 1987 to 2000 with data from 2001 to 2014.\n\n\"Our analysis showed that, over the last few years, the risk of heat-induced heart attack with increasing average daily temperature has risen compared to the previous investigation period,\" Chen said in a statement.\n\nIndividuals with diabetes or hyperlipidaemia -- a condition in which there are high levels of fat particles (lipids) in the blood -- were particularly at risk over the latter period.\n\nThe researchers suspect that this is partly a result of global warming, but that it is also a consequence of an increase in risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, which have made the population more susceptible to heat.\n\n\"Our study suggests that greater consideration should be given to high temperatures as a potential trigger for heart attacks -- especially in view of climate change,\" said lead researcher Alexandra Schneider.\n\n\"Extreme weather events, like the 2018 heat waves in Europe, could in future result in an increase in cardiovascular disease,\" Schneider said.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests a lower risk in the future, but this lower risk was not significant and very cold days will continue to represent a potential trigger for heart attacks,\" he said.\n\nTo what extent increases in heat-related heart attacks will be counterbalanced by a decrease in cold-related heart attacks is not yet clear, researchers said.\n\nThe team is currently performing extrapolations aimed at modelling this change in risk both in scenarios where the world meets the Paris Agreement target to restrict average temperature increase between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius and in scenarios where these targets are missed.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "title": "NBA playoff picture, standings, matchups, projections: No. 1 seeds still up for grabs; logjam of teams vying for home court",
    "body": "Less than a month remains in the NBA regular season and there is still so much up for grabs, including both No. 1 seeds and a three-team logjam for home-court advantage in the West. What follows is everything you need to know about where things stand entering Thursday, March 14. Team are listed in order of projected finishing seed. This post will continue to update for the remainder of the season as we keep track right down to the wire.\n\nNOTE: Our SportsLine model, developed by predictive data engineer Stephen Oh, simulates the entire season 10,000 times to produce the most unbiased and precise projections imaginable.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE Fight for No. 1\n\nGolden State Warriors (No. 1 seed)\n\nPlaying without Kevin Durant, Golden State got back on track with a 106-104 win over Houston on Wednesday night to maintain its slim lead over the Nuggets for the top spot out West. They've got a couple tough games coming up, and one matchup with the Nuggets still remaining. The Warriors have been vocal about wanting the No. 1 seed, if only as a goal to aim at as they prioritize getting in a groove down the stretch.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: ThreeSportsLine Projection: 86 percent to earn No. 1 seedRemaining games: 15 (eight road, seven home)Strength of remaining schedule: .487 (13th-easiest in league)Next three games: at Thunder, at Spurs, vs. Timberwolves\n\nTiebreaker: Currently own tiebreaker 2-1 over Denver (one matchup left)Denver Nuggets (No. 2 seed)\n\nDenver has a tough go down the stretch with 11 of its final 16 games against current playoff teams. Mike Malone has said he doesn't even talk about the No. 1 seed with his team; they're just keeping their head down until the finish line. Frankly, the No. 1 seed isn't as important for the Nuggets because as the No. 2 seed, the only potential series in which they wouldn't have home-court advantage is the conference finals. If they make it that far, they're playing with house money anyway.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: FiveSportsLine Projection: 6.3 percent to earn No. 1 seedRemaining games: 16 (nine road, seven home)Strength of remaining schedule: .536 (ninth-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Mavericks. vs. Pacers, at Celtics\n\nTiebreaker: Currently trail Warriors 2-1 head-to-head (one matchup left) Fighting for Home-Court Advantage Oklahoma City Thunder (No. 3 seed)\n\nThe Thunder currently hold the slimmest of leads on the No. 3 seed but our projections have them falling to No. 5. The Thunder got big wins over Brooklyn and Utah in their last two, but it gets tough from here. Four of their next five are against the Pacers, Warriors and Raptors twice. The good news is their schedule, though against tough opponents, is home-heavy the rest of the way.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: SevenSportsLine Projection: 16 percent to earn No. 3 seed, 46.7 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 14 (nine home, five road)Strength of remaining schedule: .580 (third-toughest in league)Next three games: at Pacers, vs. Warriors, vs. Heat\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over both Houston and PortlandHouston Rockets (No. 4 seed)\n\nHouston is currently No. 4 in the West but our projections have them vaulting to No. 3 by season's end. The West No. 3 spot is a swing seed because whoever ends up there would avoid the Warriors -- assuming they finish No. 1 -- until the conference finals, while the 4-5 seeds would have to battle each other for the right to see Golden State in Round 2.\n\nEric Gordon recently said he believes the Rockets are the only team that can knock off Golden State, and he's perhaps right in the sense that nobody has given the Warriors as much trouble over the last two years. The Rockets are 3-1 vs. the Warriors this season and 8-6 over the past two years, including that seven-game WCF last season. One thing to keep in mind: Houston cannot win the tiebreaker vs. OKC or Portland if this thing comes down to a dead heat, which it very well could. The Rockets have already lost both those season series.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: SevenSportsLine Projection: 38.5 percent to earn No. 3 seed, 82.8 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 14 (seven home, seven road)Strength of remaining schedule: .462 (seventh-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Suns, vs. Timberwolves, at Hawks\n\nTiebreaker: Already lost tiebreaker to both OKC and PortlandPortland Trail Blazers (No. 5 seed)\n\nThe Blazers currently sit at No. 5 but our projections have them reaching No. 4. Portland, winners of two straight, currently holds the tiebreaker over Houston if it comes to that, but it has already lost the tiebreaker to OKC. Again, getting to No. 3 would be the big thing to avoid Golden State until the conference finals. There's no other team Portland wouldn't at least have a shot to beat.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: EightSportsLine Projection: 21 percent to earn No. 3 seed, 58.6 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 15 (eight road, seven home)Strength of remaining schedule: .490 (14th-easiest in league)Next three games: at Pelicans, at Spurs, vs. Pacers\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Houston, lost tiebreaker to OKC Rounding Out the Field San Antonio Spurs (No. 6 seed)\n\nThe Spurs are currently No. 6 in the West but our projections have them sliding to No. 7 -- largely because of current 7-seed Utah's super-soft remaining schedule. The Spurs also have a pretty soft, home-heavy schedule down the stretch. They have already lost the tiebreaker to Utah and hold a slim tiebreaker edge over the Clippers (2-2 head-to-head) via a better conference record, which is far from cemented. San Antonio is getting hot at the right time, having won six straight including victories over the Bucks, Nuggets and Thunder.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 10SportsLine Projection: 99.9 percent to make playoffs, 4.4 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 14 (eight home, six road)Strength of remaining schedule: .462 (seventh-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Knicks, vs. Blazers, vs. Warriors\n\nTiebreaker: Currently owns tiebreaker over Clippers via conference record; already lost tiebreaker to JazzUtah Jazz (No. 7 seed)\n\nThe Jazz are currently No. 7 in the West but our projections have them reaching No. 6 because they have the softest schedule in the league down the stretch. But they have to take advantage. Its last two losses have come to the Pelicans and the Grizzlies. It's not out of the question that Utah can get on a run against some weak opponents and make it to a top-four seed. Entering Thursday, the Jazz are only three games back in the loss column of the No. 4 spot. At the same time, they're only four games up on the No. 9 Kings. They're most likely fighting with the Spurs and Clippers for seeds 6-8.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 11SportsLine Projection: 99.9 percent to make playoffs, 8.4 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 15 (eight home, seven road)Strength of remaining schedule: .414 (easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Timberwolves, vs. Nets, at Wizards\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Spurs and ClippersLos Angeles Clippers (No. 8 seed)\n\nThe Clippers have won five of six and continue to be one of the best stories in the league -- depending on your perspective. If the Clippers make the playoffs, they lose their 2019 first-round pick, which is lottery protected, to the Celtics. When they traded Tobias Harris to the Sixers, there was some thought that they were looking to fall out of the playoff race and into the lottery, which would allow them to keep that pick. That doesn't look like it's going to be the case.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 10SportsLine Projection: 97.6 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 13 (eight home, five road)Strength of remaining schedule: .467 (ninth-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Bulls, vs. Nets, vs. Pacers\n\nTiebreaker: Already lost tiebreaker to Jazz, currently losing tiebreaker to Spurs via conference record Outside Looking In Sacramento Kings (No. 9 seed)\n\nSacramento is 4.5 games back -- three in the loss column -- of the final playoff spot.\n\nSportsLine Projection: 0.5 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 16 (nine road, seven home)Strength of remaining schedule: .476 (11th-easiest in league)Next three games: at Celtics, at 76ers, vs. Bulls\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Spurs, already lost tiebreaker to Clippers EASTERN CONFERENCE Fighting for No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks (No. 1 seed)\n\nThe Bucks are the first team to reach 50 wins and have a relatively soft schedule down the stretch. One thing to consider: While the No. 1 seed in the East carries with it home-court advantage, it also might lead to a tougher path through the bracket. If Indiana were to end up at No. 3 while other current seeds hold, it would be the No. 2 seed Raptors that would be in line to avoid the Bucks, Sixers and Celtics until the conference finals, while No. 1 seed Milwaukee could potentially have to go through two of those teams beginning in the second round. If Indiana stays out of the No. 3 seed, that scenario becomes moot, but it's something to watch.\n\nMagic Number: Already clinched playoff spot; four to clinch top-four seedSportsLine Projection: 95 percent to get No. 1 seedRemaining games: 14 (nine home, five road)Strength of remaining schedule: .479 (12th-easiest in league)Next three games: at Heat, vs. 76ers, vs. Lakers\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over RaptorsToronto Raptors (No. 2 seed)\n\nThe Raptors, already projected as a certain top-four seed, have won four of their last seven games and, as mentioned above, could end up being in the perfect spot in the No. 2 seed if Indiana was to finish in third. If that were to happen, current seeds would pit the Raptors against Brooklyn and Indiana in the first two rounds, thus only forcing them to go through one of -- rather than two of -- Boston, Philly or Milwaukee -- and not until the conference finals -- for a trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nMagic Number: Already clinched playoff spot; seven to clinch top-four seedSportsLine Projection: 4 percent to get No. 1 seedRemaining games: 14 (nine home, five road)Strength of remaining schedule: .479 (12th-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Lakers, at Pistons, vs. Knicks\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Sixers, already lost tiebreaker to Bucks Fighting for Home-Court Advantage Philadelphia 76ers (No. 3 seed)\n\nThe Sixers look like a virtual lock to end up in the top four. The key is staying in that No. 3 seed, which, if current seeds were to hold, would put them against Brooklyn in the first round. If the Sixers fall to No. 4, it will likely be a first-round matchup with Boston. That's a big difference.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: OneSportsLine Projection: 92.8 percent to get top-four seed, 1 percent to get No. 1 seedRemaining games: 14 (nine road, five home)Strength of remaining schedule: .472 (10th-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Kings, at Bucks, at Hornets\n\nTiebreaker: Own tiebreaker over Pacers, Already lost tiebreaker to BucksIndiana Pacers (No. 4 seed)\n\nWhat the Pacers have done in the absence of Victor Oladipo has been really impressive, but the schedule turns murderous starting Wednesday, which begins a run of eight straight games against current playoff teams.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: OneSportsLine Projection: 53.4 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 14 (eight road, six home)Strength of remaining schedule: .568 (fifth-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Thunder, at Nuggets, at Blazers\n\nTiebreaker: Already lost tiebreaker to Sixers, season series with Boston tied 1-1 with two to playBoston Celtics (No. 5 seed)\n\nBoston is currently the No. 5 seed out East and, despite Indiana's tough slate down the stretch, our SportsLine projections have the Celtics staying there. Entering Thursday, Boston trails Indiana by two games, but as mentioned above, it also has two games left vs. Indiana. If Boston can get both of those, these projections will certainly change.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: ThreeSportsLine Projection: 53.8 percent to get top-four seedRemaining games: 14 (seven home, seven road)Strength of remaining schedule: .502 (14th-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Kings, vs. Hawks, vs. Nuggets\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Sixers, season series with Indiana tied 1-1 with two to play Rounding Out the Field Brooklyn Nets (No. 6 seed)\n\nThere is a clear cutoff at the No. 6 seed with Brooklyn trailing No. 5 Boston by seven games in the loss column with 12 to play. It's a five-team race for the last three spots, and Brooklyn should have enough of a cushion to hold on despite its brutal remaining schedule. That said, our SportsLine projections have them falling behind Detroit to the No. 7 seed because of that schedule.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: EightSportsLine Projection: 91.5 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 12 (eight road, four home)Strength of remaining schedule: .605 (toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Jazz, at Clippers, at Kings\n\nTiebreaker: Clinched tiebreaker over Pistons, trail season series vs. Miami 2-1 with one to playDetroit Pistons (No. 7 seed)\n\nThe Pistons are currently in the No. 7 spot but our projections have them jumping the Nets for the No. 6 seed by season's end.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 10SportsLine Projection: 95.8 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 15 (eight home, seven road)Strength of remaining schedule: .506 (13th-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Lakers, vs. Raptors, at Cavs\n\nTiebreaker: Currently losing tiebreaker to Miami via Heat being a division leader, already lost tiebreaker to NetsMiami Heat (No. 8 seed)\n\nThe Heat are currently No. 8 and our SportsLine projections have them staying there. Tough stretch coming up for Miami with dates against the Thunder, Spurs and the Bucks twice in four of their next five. Miami is battling to keep Orlando and Charlotte at the Nos. 9 and 10 spots to avoid the lottery. Our projections are pretty certain about the first seven seeds in the East, but this last spot is far less certain for Miami, which has the seventh-toughest remaining schedule.\n\nMagic Number to clinch playoff spot: 12SportsLine Projection: 63.4 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 15 (nine road, six home)Strength of remaining schedule: .543 (seventh-toughest in league)Next three games: vs. Bucks vs. Hornets, at Thunder\n\nTiebreaker: Currently own tiebreaker over Detroit and Brooklyn, currently trail Orlando 2-1 in season series Outside Looking In Orlando Magic (No. 9 seed)\n\nIf the Magic are going to make a move, the time is now with their next four games all at home against the Cavs, Hawks, Pelicans and Grizzlies. And the last remaining game vs. Miami on March 26 is a virtual must-win.\n\nSportsLine Projection: 40.1 percent to make playoffsRemaining games: 13 (seven road, six road)Strength of remaining schedule: .459 (fifth-easiest in league)Next three games: vs. Cavs, vs. Hawks, vs. Pelicans\n\nTiebreaker: Currently leads Miami 2-1 in season seriesCharlotte Hornets (No. 10 seed)\n\nSportsLine projections give the current No. 10 seed Hornets just a 6.8 percent chance to make the playoffs. We'll revisit them next week if they can string a few wins together and make up some ground.",

    "title": "The ocean keeps gulping up a colossal amount of CO2 from the air, but will it last?",
    "body": "The ocean keeps gulping up a colossal amount of CO2 from the air, but will it last?\n\nThe ocean has proved to be an exceptionally selfless and dependable planetary companion.\n\nWith no benefit to itself, Earth's vast sea has gulped up around 30 percent of the carbon dioxide humans emitted into Earth's atmosphere over the last century. Critically, scientists have now confirmed that the ocean in recent decades has continued its steadfast rate of CO2 absorption, rather than letting the potent greenhouse gas further saturate the skies.\n\nTheir research, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that between 1994 and 2007, the oceans reliably sucked up about 31 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, even as CO2 concentrations skyrocketed to their highest levels in at least 800,000 years. This means the ocean is now absorbing a significantly larger bulk of carbon, amounting to well over 2 trillion tons each year.\n\n\"We can regard what the ocean is doing for us as providing a service, by mitigating CO2 in the atmosphere,\" said Matthew Long, an oceanographer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study.\n\nBut a weighty question still looms: How much longer can we rely on the ocean to so effectively store away carbon dioxide, and stave off considerably more global warming?\n\n\"At some point the ability of the ocean to absorb carbon will start to diminish,\" said Jeremy Mathis, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate scientist who coauthored the study. \"It means atmospheric CO2 levels could go up faster than they already are.\"\n\n\"That's a big deal,\" Mathis emphasized.\n\nIt's a big deal because carbon dioxide levels aren't just abnormally high, but today's accelerated pace of heat and carbon dioxide rise is nearly unparalleled on Earth. \"What's important to recognize is the changes humanity is driving at present are commensurate with the most significant events in the history of life on this planet,\" said Long. That means -- as long as we continue emitting profound amounts of heat-trapping gases -- we'll need the ocean to keep absorbing massive quantities of CO2, so the planet doesn't grow absurdly hot.\n\nFortunately, there's still time. For the next 50 years or so, the oceans will continue to gulp up about the same amount of carbon dioxide.\n\n\"[The ocean's] going to continue to help suck up CO2,\" said Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who had no role in the research. \"It's like it's eating at a really big buffet, really slowly,\" he explained. \"It'll keep going to the buffet for a long time.\"\n\nThat's good news for us, a species whose carbon emissions likely won't even peak for another decade.\n\nBut it's terrible news for the ocean.\n\n\"The ocean will keep cleaning up some of our mess, but it does that at a price to itself,\" said Willis.\n\nAs they say, nice guys finish last.\n\nThe ocean grows more acidic as it sucks up CO2. \"Every additional bit of CO2 the ocean takes up protects us from the worst of climate change but does damage to plants and animals in the ocean,\" said Curtis Deutsch, a chemical oceanographer at the University of Washington, who also had no involvement in the study.\n\n\"The ocean will keep cleaning up some of our mess, but it does that at a price to itself\"\n\nJust how much damage? That's a hot area of research. Increasingly acidic waters are expected to dissolve the skeletons of big swaths of coral, for instance. But it's not just acidified waters that critters must worry about. The oceans also absorb about 93 percent of human-created heat on Earth, which boosts the odds of deadly marine heat waves -- the type that killed 30 percent of corals in the Great Barrier Reef over just nine months. What's more, warmer waters have resulted in the loss of oxygen in the seas, which much sea life needs to survive. That's a triple-whammy of potent environmental threats. \"We expect this to have substantial impacts on marine ecosystems,\" said Long.\n\nDuring the second half of this century, though, the story will change. Marine researchers still expect the oceans to gulp up considerable loads of carbon dioxide, but this ability may gradually start to diminish, noted Long. That's because ocean circulation -- in which deeper, colder waters rise to the surface and replace warmer ocean waters -- will be reduced. In short, water near the surface will have absorbed the most heat (as the world warms) and create a layer of buoyant sea. This makes it increasingly difficult for fresh waters from the deep -- which aren't yet oversaturated with carbon -- to circulate to the surface and absorb lots more CO2 from the air, Long explained.\n\nThese changes, along with ocean acidification, won't be easily reversed. \"We're essentially baking in changes that will be very long-lived,\" said Long.\n\nBut scientists don't expect any extreme or catastrophic disruptions to the ocean's carbon uptake anytime in the next century, at least. \"The ocean would basically have to stop circulating,\" said Deutsch. \"And that's just not feasible.\"\n\nStill, marine scientists emphasize that we must continue monitoring the oceans to ensure the ocean is as dependable as we think it is, and critically, to watch for any unexpected changes amid Earth's rapidly changing climate. This is no simple task. Collecting this ocean data often involves six to eight-week-long research missions across vast lengths of sea (like Alaska to Hawaii), wherein scientists collect water samples every 10 miles. \"It's timely and fairly expensive,\" said Mathis. \"But we have to continue to invest in the science that allows us to go out and do these surveys.\"\n\n\"Otherwise we're just flying blind -- we just don't understand,\" added Long.\n\nAlthough the oceans have undoubtedly quelled a significant amount of warming over the last century, they can't ever be humanity's total climate savior. There will just be too much carbon dioxide saturating the air, too much for the seas to handle. The ocean won't stave off radical climate disruption, deadly heat waves, and ruinous damage to crops. In other words, it wouldn't be good if we ever reach a point where the climate has overloaded the oceans with CO2 and heat. But we would already be in big trouble.\n\n\"So it could get worse,\" said Long. \"But it will already be pretty bad.\"",

    "body": "By Tim Reynolds\u2009|\u2009AP March 13 at 10:01 PM\n\nMIAMI -- Justise Winslow scored 16 points, and the Miami Heat opened the second half on a 21-0 run on the way to an easy 108-74 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.\n\nIt was the biggest unanswered-point run and largest victory margin of the season for the Heat, who are trying to hang on in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Dion Waiters scored 14 points, Josh Richardson and Hassan Whiteside each scored 13 and Dwyane Wade had 11 for Miami.\n\nBlake Griffin scored 13 points for Detroit, which got 11 from Wayne Ellington. The Pistons have now dropped consecutive games for the first time since Jan. 25 and 29 -- and both were blowout losses, with this one on the heels of a 103-75 rout in Brooklyn on Wednesday.\n\nDetroit missed its first 11 shots of the third quarter, eight of them from 3-point range. A 54-49 Miami lead at the half looked tenuous.\n\nBefore long, the outcome was obvious.\n\nBam Adebayo had seven points in the 21-0 run, Waiters and Kelly Olynyk each added five, and the game was obviously never going to be in doubt again.\n\nMiami Heat guard Dwyane Wade (3) drives against Detroit Pistons guard Luke Kennard during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Wednesday, March 13, 2019, in Miami. (Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press)\n\nMiami (32-35) is still No. 8 in the East, now two games ahead of No. 9 Orlando and two games back of No. 7 Detroit.\n\nAndre Drummond fouled out with 6:30 left and finished with five points and nine rebounds -- snapping his run of 19 consecutive double-doubles, which left him tied with Bob Lanier for the Pistons' all-time record streak in that department.\n\nIt wasn't Drummond's night.\n\nIt wasn't the Pistons' night in any way. They shot 36 percent, got outrebounded 51-36 and were 8 for 37 from 3-point range. It went down as Detroit's second-worst loss of the season, topped only by a 37-pointer at Indiana on Dec. 28.\n\nThere have been four instances of a team holding another to eight points or less in a quarter this season.\n\nMiami is responsible for three of them.\n\nHouston held Chicago to seven in the third quarter on Nov. 3 -- and the rest of the list is all Heat. Miami held the Los Angeles Clippers to eight points in the fourth quarter on Dec. 8, and kept the Milwaukee Bucks to that many in the first quarter on Dec. 22.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Detroit hadn't lost a quarter by 25 points since Oct. 30, 2010. ... Drummond was looking to join Kevin Love (53), Dwight Howard (separate streaks of 33 and 20), Griffin (27) and Russell Westbrook (23, earlier this season) as players in the last decade with 20 straight double-doubles.\n\nHeat: Miami opened on an 8-0 run, its best to start a game this season. ... It was Miami's 600th sellout at AmericanAirlines Arena -- the last 413 of those coming consecutively -- and 900th home sellout overall. ... The Heat celebrated Pride Night, and the national anthem before the game was performed by the South Florida Gay Men's Chorus.\n\nWADE BLOCKS\n\nWade had a first-quarter blocked shot against Detroit's 7-foot-1 Thon Maker. It was the 879th block of Wade's career, leaving him 14 shy of Michael Jordan's all-time regular-season record for guards. When adding playoff games, Wade already has more blocks than any guard in history.\n\nSLOW START\n\nDetroit has trailed after the first quarter in each of its last five games, and the 12-point deficit after 12 minutes in this one matched the Pistons' third-largest, after-one-quarter hole this season. They had rallied to win three of the first four in those cases -- but didn't come close in this one.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Host the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday.\n\nHeat: Host Milwaukee on Friday.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Now, they'll try to get a new streak going on Wednesday night when they face the Miami Heat in South Beach.\n\nMiami also saw a lengthy winning streak snapped in their latest outing; they're coming off a 21-point defeat to the Toronto Raptors, who didn't even have Kawhi Leonard in that game.\n\nEach team will be eager for a victory in this matchup, as they're currently battling for playoff positioning in the Eastern Conference. The Pistons enter the game in seventh place at 34-32, while the Heat are in eighth at 31-35. While the Pistons have much more of cushion -- four games ahead of the ninth-place Orlando Magic -- neither team has clinched a playoff spot yet.\n\nHow to watch Pistons at Heat\n\nDate: Wednesday, Mar. 13\n\nTime: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: American Airlines Arena -- Miami, Florida\n\nStreaming: fuboTV (free trial - NBA League Pass add-on available)\n\nLive stats: GameTrackerOdds: Heat -1.5Odds and analysis\n\nCheck Sportsline's NBA pick sheet for all your daily odds.\n\nStorylines\n\nPistons: Thanks to some red-hot 3-point shooting and one of the best stretches of Andre Drummond's career, the Pistons had rattled off five straight wins before getting crushed by the Nets earlier this week. Now, they travel to South Beach to take on the Heat in what should be a good test for them. Will they bounce back after a tough defeat? Or will that embarrassing loss turn into a spiral that puts them in a fight just to make the playoffs?\n\nHeat: The Heat are also coming off a bad loss, as they fell by 21 points to a Raptors side that wasn't even playing with Kawhi Leonard. Many of the same questions face them as well. How they bounce back from that defeat will go a long way towards determining if they make the playoffs again this season. Currently, they're just one game up on the ninth-place Magic, and one and a half games ahead of the 10th-place Hornets. At this point, every single game is a must-win for Miami.\n\nGame prediction, pick\n\nThe Heat are very slight favorites in this game, which seems about right. The two teams are pretty evenly matched, but the Heat are at home. Given the Pistons' pretty poor road record, I'll take the Heat to cover and win in this one.",

    "body": "There are six games on the Wednesday night NBA schedule, but the slate isn't short on star power. The night begins with Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder (-7.5) hosting D'Angelo Russell and the Brooklyn Nets, with the main event at 9:30 p.m. ET as James Harden, Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets (-3) host Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and the Golden State Warriors. Fans everywhere will be playing off NBA odds for these games, but before locking in any NBA picks of your own, you need to see what SportsLine expert Mike Barner is saying about the action. He's on an astonishing hot streak that's lining his followers' pockets with cash.\n\nBarner is a respected NBA Fantasy expert, both season-long and DFS, whose work has appeared in Sports Illustrated and on Yahoo, RotoWire and KFFL. He's also been featured on ESPN Radio. He digs deep into the data, examining team trends and projecting game outcomes, while watching as many games as possible to gain an edge.\n\nWith his unmatched analysis and 24-7 dedication, Barner spots opportunities against the spread as well as on totals. Barner's expertise has been on full display lately -- he's hit on 44 of his last 71 NBA picks, a massive 62-percent win rate that's brought in more than $1,400 to $100 players in a short amount of time.\n\nNow he's going huge once again, putting together a three-team parlay of NBA best bets for Wednesday that could return a massive 6-1 payout.\n\nWe'll give one key part of the parlay away: Barner is backing the Pistons (+1.5) on the road against the Heat at 7:30 p.m. ET. Barner has nailed four of his last six picks involving Detroit.\n\nBarner knows both teams just had impressive win streaks snapped. The Pistons (34-32) had won five in a row before Monday's 28-point loss against the Nets, while the Heat (31-35) had their four-game win streak snapped Sunday with a loss to the Raptors.\n\nThis game is at Miami, but no playoff contender is as bad at home as the Heat, who are 15-19 overall and even worse against the spread.\n\n\"The Pistons have won both of their last two games against the Heat, including a 23-point victory in Miami a little over two weeks ago,\" Barner told SportsLine. \"The Heat are only 14-20 ATS at home, including 7-17 ATS as the home favorite. Roll with the Pistons and the points.\"\n\nConfidently lock in the Pistons to cover, and you could be well on your way to a colossal parlay payoff.\n\nBarner has also identified a key injury that has him jumping all over the spread in another game. Find out everything you need to know to complete your parlay selections over at SportsLine.\n\nSo which Wednesday NBA picks should you back for a huge 6-1 payout?

    "title": "How to make kedgeree | Felicity Cloake's masterclass",
    "body": "This quintessentially British breakfast dish started off life as khichdi, a soupy, Indian mixture of lentils and rice embraced by the British Raj thanks to its passing resemblance to porridge. Rice aside, fishy kedgeree has little in common with the original, except for, as Sri Owen puts it, also being 'good for invalids or those with hangovers' - and for brunch, lunch and dinner, too.\n\nPrep/soak 30 min\n\nCook 30 min\n\nServes 4\n\n450g basmati rice\n\n1 large onion\n\n1 large green chilli\n\n500g smoked haddock\n\n2 eggs\n\n120g butter\n\n2 cardamom pods, crushed\n\n1 tbsp curry powder\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 small bunch chives, finely chopped\n\n1 small bunch coriander\n\n1 lemon\n\nKashmiri or mild chilli powder, or cayenne pepper\n\n1 Soak the rice\n\nPut the rice into a fine sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs fairly clear. Tip into a large pan, cover with cold water and leave to soak for 30 minutes - this helps ensure a fluffier end result. If you don't have time, you can proceed immediately, but you may need to increase the cooking time slightly in the next step.\n\n2 Cook the rice\n\nWhile the rice is soaking, peel and finely chop the onion and deseed and slice the green chilli. Drain the rice again, put it back into the pan and cover with 600ml fresh cold water. Bring to a boil over a high heat, stir, then cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid (if it's a little loose, put a thin tea towel underneath the lid), turn the heat right down and leave to cook for 25 minutes.\n\n3 Poach the fish\n\nWhile the rice is cooking, put a kettle of water on to boil. Put the fish (skin side up, if it has its skin) in a shallow pan or bowl just large enough to hold it. Pour over the boiling water from the kettle to cover, and leave to sit for 10 minutes, or until just firm (check, because this will vary depending on the thickness of the fillet).\n\n4 Boil the eggs\n\nBoil the kettle again, then pour the boiling water into a small pan. Bring back to a simmer and gently lower in the eggs. Cook for six minutes for soft-boiled, seven for loosely set yolks, eight for fudgy yolks and nine minutes for hard-boiled. Fill the sink with cold water and drop the cooked eggs in there to stop them cooking any further.\n\n5 Flake the fish\n\nRemove the fish from the water and, once it's cool enough to handle, pull off and discard the skin, along with the soaking liquid (or tip both into the dog's bowl, if you have an obliging one). Break up the flesh into large flakes, and set aside. Put a wet tea towel on to a heatproof work surface.\n\n6 Peel the eggs\n\nOnce the rice is ready, turn off the heat but do not remove the lid (this is to keep the steam in) and put the pan on the wet tea towel. Leave to sit undisturbed for five minutes, then fluff up with a fork. Tap the round end of the eggs on to a hard surface to crack them, then carefully peel and cut in half.\n\n7 Fry the onion\n\nMelt the butter in a large frying pan over a lowish heat and add the chopped onion. Fry gently until softened and translucent, but not browned, then turn up the heat slightly and tip in the chilli, cardamom pods and curry powder, and stir until fragrant, squashing the cardamom pods with the spoon to bruise them.\n\n8 Stir in the rice\n\nTip the cooked rice into the frying pan and stir to coat each grain with the oniony spiced butter. Fold through the fish flakes until evenly distributed and everything is nice and hot, then season the rice to taste. Finely chop the chives and roughly chop the coriander. Cut the lemon into wedges.\n\n9 Garnish and serve\n\nSpoon the kedgeree into a large serving dish or four individual plates (or leave it in the pan, if that's your vibe), add the egg halves and scatter the herbs on top. Season each egg with salt and a pinch of chilli powder, and serve immediately.\n\nThe Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish. For ratings in your region, check: UK; Australia; US.",

    "title": "Americans in cool states misjudge threat from rising heat waves",
    "body": "NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Americans most at risk from more frequent and intense heat waves tend to misjudge the deadly dangers hot spells can pose to their health, scientists said on Tuesday.\n\nPeople's vulnerability to heat waves is growing as cooler states become hotter, in part because air conditioning and other ways to cool down are less common there, according to a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.\n\nRight now, people in cooler areas \"don't experience hotter weather as frequently,\" said co-author Peter Howe from Utah State University.\n\nThat means \"they have less of that experience ... to handle those hot days\".\n\nGlobal temperatures are on course for a 3 to 5 degrees Celsius (5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) rise this century, overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C (3.6F) or less, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization has said.\n\nIn the United States, hot years are projected to soon become more common as annual average temperatures - already a degree higher than in 1901 - continue to rise, according to the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government report.\n\nAfter surveying more than 9,000 people in all 50 states, researchers carrying out the heat wave study discovered that people in northern states, including in the northern Midwest, had fewer health concerns about extreme heat than those living in the country's south.\n\nResidents of the normally temperate Rocky Mountains and Appalachians were among the least concerned by extreme heat, the study said, while those in sweltering Hawaii, Texas and Louisiana were most worried.\n\nBut previous research has shown that as climate change pushes temperatures up, residents of the northeastern United States and those living in high elevations are at particularly high risk of heat-related complications, the researchers said.\n\nThat's because they often lack air conditioning and other means of combating extreme heat, and are less acclimatized to potentially dangerous temperatures.\n\nHeat can exacerbate existing health conditions and contribute to heat strokes, dehydration and heat exhaustion, Howe said.\n\nElderly people also were often oblivious to the risks of extreme heat to their health, even though they constitute one of the highest risk groups, the findings showed.\n\n\"People generally, if they are older, they don't consider themselves to be elderly,\" he said - and so don't see themselves as particularly at risk.\n\nHeat in 2017 killed more people than any other weather-related disaster except floods, according to the National Weather Service. Over the last 30 years heat has been the biggest cause of weather-related deaths.\n\nA 2014 study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives said a 5 degree Fahrenheit increase in average temperature would lead an extra 1,900 deaths per summer across 105 U.S. cities",

    "body": "Insider Picks writes about products and services to help you navigate when shopping online. Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective.\n\nI recently purchased the InvoSpa Shiatsu Back, Neck, and Shoulder Massager with Heat from Amazon for $50, and it is a game changer for anyone like me who struggles with back and neck pain on a daily basis. My life is very different now that I get daily, professional-grade massages. If I were to visit a masseuse that regularly in New York City, I'd be down close to $100 per week at minimum. What makes this at-home massager even better than going to a professional, however, is that you remain in total control as you use it. This massager also has a timer, so it automatically shuts off every 15 minutes.\n\nAs a freelancer in New York City, I'm regularly hauling around a backpack filled with my computer, its charger, a work book, a fun book, hand sanitizer, a water bottle, a just-in-case umbrella, and about 14 inkless pens. My bag not only burdens my back, but it also strains my neck, shoulders, legs, and arms as I contort my body to fit into crowded subways and carry it in one hand while the other roots around for an elusive, working pen. Then when I arrive at my destination, I sit down and type for hours, hunching over my laptop like Golem guarding his precious.\n\nNone of this activity helps ease my back pain. After I tried repeatedly to hand-massage myself for relief (about as satisfying as scratching that itch at the middle of your back), my friend whose job entails a lot of upper body work let me try her at-home shiatsu back, neck, and shoulder massager with heat. I'm not exaggerating when I say it changed my life. I immediately went home and ordered my own off of Amazon for $50.\n\nThose times when I've tried to get a knot out of my upper back by using the edge of a door frame? This kneading massager from InvoSpa is infinitely more effective in its ability to dig deep into my muscles, relaxing tensions I barely even knew I had. Its pack-like shape - featuring two straps you can slip your arms through while positioning dual massagers comfortably on your neck, back, or shoulders - mimics that of my backpack, allowing me to hit all the sore spots that wearing my bag daily creates.\n\nThe apparatus has a groove for your neck, with one massager on either side, each consisting of four, rotating nodes. The four larger nodes loosen up your muscles while the four smaller nodes really get in there, tackling the most stubborn knots. Four controllers on one strap let you turn the massagers off and on, change the direction of the rotation, alter the speed, and switch on and off the heat, respectively. I find that the direction of the nodes changes regularly enough, so I end up pressing the heat button most. Using heat at the start of the massage helps relax my muscles before I apply more pressure for heavy kneading, at which point I turn the heat off.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Dit is de familie Albrecht: de geheimzinnige erfgenamen van het Aldi-imperium die samen \u20ac34 miljard waard zijn\n\nI mentioned that this massager has changed my life, and it's true - my life is very different now that I get daily, professional-grade massages. If I were to visit a masseuse that regularly in New York City, I'd be down close to $100 per week at minimum.\n\nFoto: As with all massagers, it's also not good for you to use it for too long. Luckily, this one has a timer, so it automatically shuts off every 15 minutes.sourceAmazon\n\nWhat makes this at-home massager even better than going to a professional, however, is that you remain in total control as you use it.\n\nThe straps make it very easy to manipulate its position, letting you reach the nagging sore parts that are nearly impossible to explain to other people (\"No, a little more to the left...\"). And even though it's called a \"back, neck, and shoulder massager,\" it feels amazing on the soles of my (clean) feet.\n\nHowever, you can't use the massager on any old body part. I learned this the hard way. The manual warns you're not supposed to put it on \"joints and bony parts of the body,\" which I didn't read until after I'd ended up with some sore knees joints - a fate people who read manuals (or this article) can easily avoid. As with all massagers, it's also not good for you to use it for too long. Luckily, this one has a timer, so it automatically shuts off every 15 minutes.\n\nThis massager's only other minor downside is that it has to be plugged into the wall to work. That being said, the cord is plenty long. I've never had a hard time getting it to my couch, bed, or desk chair, some of which are closer to outlets than others. Impressively, it's still portable. It comes with a car plug and a convenient, handheld case.\n\nEven if you don't lug around a full backpack every day and hunch over your computer, doing any kind of physical work, exercising, or even just experiencing stress can lead to tight, painful muscles. I use my at-home massager both after work and after runs, and I'd highly recommend others do the same. It's giving me a foot massage right now.\n\nBuy the InvoSpa Shiatsu Back, Neck, and Shoulder Massager with Heat at Amazon for $50.",

    "body": "Booker T and Stevie Ray have joined the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2019\n\nHarlem Heat, compromised of brothers Booker T & Stevie Ray, was one of the most successful tag teams of this generation, and now the duo will be recognized for their efforts. On Monday, WWE announced that Harlem Heat will serve as the latest inductees into the 2019 WWE Hall of Fame, joining D-Generation X, The Honky Tonk Man and Torrie Wilson. News of the induction was first reported by USA Today.\n\nDebuting together in 1993, Harlem Heat dominated the WCW tag team scene throughout the decade of the 1990s, winning the WCW tag team championship a staggering 10 times throughout its run. The two would briefly split in 1998, with Booker T beginning what would eventually lead to a memorable career and Stevie Ray joining the nWo. They would reform briefly in 1999 after Stevie Ray left the infamous faction before feuding with one another in the waning years of the promotion. Harlem Heat's final match as a team took place in 2015 for Booker T's Reality of Wrestling promotion based out of Houston.\n\nBig fan of WWE? Subscribe to our podcast -- State of Combat with Brian Campbell -- where we go in depth on everything you need to know in WWE each week.\n\nWith this induction, Booker T will join an exclusive group. This will mark the former world heavyweight champion's second Hall of Fame induction, being enshrined as a singles star in 2013 with his brother Stevie Ray presenting him. Booker T joins Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels -- who will also be enjoying his second induction this year as a member of DX -- as the only two-time WWE Hall of Famers. The 2019 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony takes place the night before WrestleMania 35 on April 6 inside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nMore WWE news, rumorsBrie Bella has put a bow on her in-ring career. On the latest edition of \"Total Bellas\" that aired on Sunday night as the Fastlane pay-per-view was taking place, Bella announced the plans to remove herself from the ring to focus more on her family. Bella made the decision to call it quits following the Evolution pay-per-view last October where she accompanied sister Nikki to the ring in the main event for her Raw women's title match against Ronda Rousey. Her last in-ring appearance took place on the Aug. 10 edition of Raw in which she teamed with Nikki and Rousey to take on the Riott Squad, the bout in which Brie accidentally delivered the kick to Liv Morgan's face that drew mainstream headlines. Monday night's edition of Raw is set to open with a \"farewell address\" from the Shield following the victory on Sunday night at Fastlane. Also, Triple H and Batista are set to go face-to-face in Pittsburgh, Finn Balor will put this intercontinental title on the line against Bobby Lashley and the build for the Raw women's title match at WrestleMania featuring Ronda Rousey vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch will kick into high gear.",

    "body": "Perhaps an arbitrary number of cloves, the 40 in this French dish are iconic; while the chicken braises, the generous cloves become appealingly soft and spreadable. But their flavor is often spiritless.\n\nAnother offense: The chicken is tender, but the breast meat dries out and tastes wan. We wanted to revisit this classic dish to make it faster and better, so it would boast well-browned, full-flavored chicken, sweet and nutty garlic, and a savory sauce.\n\nUsing chicken pieces rather than a whole bird ensured that the meat cooked evenly_and quickly. We roasted the garlic cloves first to caramelize them and develop their flavor and then added them to the braising liquid with the chicken.\n\nFinishing the braised chicken under the broiler made the skin crispy. Some shallots and herbs added flavor to the sauce, and several roasted garlic cloves, smashed into a paste, thickened and flavored the sauce. If using a kosher chicken, skip the brining process. Avoid heads of garlic that have begun to sprout (the green shoots will make the sauce taste bitter).\n\nTie the rosemary and thyme sprigs together with kitchen twine so they will be easy to retrieve from the pan.

    "title": "How to highlight the earthy flavor of Brussels sprouts",
    "body": "In developing a Brussels sprout gratin, we wanted to make a dish that highlighted the earthy flavor of Brussels sprouts.\n\nPre-roasting the sprouts made them rich and nutty, not cabbage-y. We made a quick, creamy Mornay sauce, using a combination of Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses, to bind the gratin.\n\nTo add crunch, we topped the gratin with toasted panko bread crumbs and more nutty Gruyere. If you can find only large Brussels sprouts (greater than 1 1/2 inches in diameter), quarter them.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 F. Grease 13 by 9 inch baking dish. Toss Brussels sprouts with oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in prepared dish. Bake until sprouts are well browned and tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and set aside to cool for at least 5 minutes or up to 30 minutes.\n\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add panko and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl and stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Wipe saucepan clean with paper towels.\n\nMelt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in now-empty saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and cook until just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in cream and broth and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, remove from heat and whisk in 1/4 cup Gruyere, Parmesan, nutmeg, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until smooth.\n\nPour cream mixture over Brussels sprouts in dish and stir to combine. Sprinkle evenly with panko mixture and remaining 1/4 cup Gruyere. Bake until bubbling around edges and golden brown on top, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\n___\n\nNutrition information per serving: 306 calories; 212 calories from fat; 24 g fat (13 g saturated; 1 g trans fats); 74 mg cholesterol; 321 mg sodium; 18 g carbohydrate; 6 g fiber; 5 g sugar; 9 g protein.\n\n___\n\nFor more recipes, cooking tips and ingredient and product reviews, visit https://www.americastestkitchen.com .

    "body": "A creamy apple and prune tart spiked with vanilla and suffused with with rich, salty butter\n\nMarch spoils us with its shots of colour, from neon-pink rhubarb and scarlet-stained blood oranges, but it will be a while before the waves of bejewelled summer fruits emerge. Not all is lost. There are varieties of apples still in great shape, especially when paired with the scent of brandy and vanilla-soaked prunes, and enrobed in brown butter custard. Happy baking.\n\nApple, prune and brown butter tart\n\nNutty, salty butter, vanilla-scented prunes, and creamy apples, all in a shortcrust case.\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nChill 45 min\n\nCook 1 hr\n\nServes 8\n\n12 prunes, roughly chopped\n\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\n160g caster sugar\n\n75ml brandy\n\n3 small or 2 large braeburn or pink lady apples, peeled, cored and cut into 2-3mm rounds\n\n80g butter\n\nSalt\n\n2 eggs\n\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\n3 tbsp double cream\n\n3 tbsp plain flour\n\nFor the pastry\n\n190g plain flour, plus extra for dusting\n\n30g icing sugar\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n100g chilled butter, chopped, plus extra for greasing\n\n1 egg, separated, the white lightly beaten\n\nFirst, make the pastry: blitz the flour, icing sugar, salt and butter in a food processor for 20-30 seconds. Add the egg yolk, blitz again until mixed, then add just enough egg white to bind it all together (reserve the rest for later). Roll the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for 45 minutes. You can do this a few days in advance if you wrap the pastry well.\n\nOnce rested, coarsely grate the pastry into a 25cm tart tin. Press evenly into the base and sides with your fingers, sprinkle with a little flour and use a small glass to roll it flat. Prick the base all over with a fork, then freeze for 20 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the prunes, vanilla, two tablespoons of the caster sugar and the brandy in a saucepan, and warm gently. Turn off the heat, and leave the prunes to macerate.\n\nRemove the pastry from the freezer, cover with baking paper and baking beans, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the beans and paper, brush the base with the remaining egg white and return to the oven for five to 10 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Remove, leave to cool and turn down the heat to 170C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.\n\nOnce the pastry is cool, scatter the apples evenly on top. Fish the prunes out of the brandy and sprinkle them over the apples.\n\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan and add a few pinches of salt. Cook over a medium heat until it turns toasty brown and smells nutty, then take off the heat and pour in the prune brandy.\n\nBeat the eggs and remaining sugar with an electric mixer until thick and fluffy. Lightly and quickly, fold in the cinnamon, cream, flour and brandy butter, then pour the mixture over the apples. Bake the tart for 30-35 minutes, until golden and just set. Leave to cool a little, then serve with creme fraiche.\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\n\nMake a gratin with celeriac and floury potatoes and top with burnt butter for a delicious alternative to the classic. Or whisk leftover creme fraiche with olive oil, parmesan and lemon juice to dress a salad of grilled Jerusalem artichokes, blue cheese, watercress and spring onion. Make a prune puree with leftover prunes - delicious with yoghurt for breakfast.",

(Sergio Flores/Reuters) By Jennifer Rubin Jennifer Rubin Opinion writer covering politics and policy, foreign and domestic Opinion writer March 11 at 7:45 AM\n\nAs North Korea's nuclear weapons program heats up, President Trump's summitry looks like a bust. \"President Trump was forced to publicly acknowledge this past week what American intelligence officials said they had long been telling the White House: Even during eight months of blossoming diplomacy, Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was steadily adding to his weapons arsenal and nuclear infrastructure.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke's pre-campaign activity heats up.\"Senior figures in O'Rourke's orbit have begun holding meetings and phone calls to discuss potential jobs with Democratic operatives, who come away with the impression that O'Rourke has made up his mind in favor of running.\"\n\nAnti-Fox News criticism heats up. \"CNN's Jeff Zucker Rips 'Propaganda' Fox News: They've 'Done Tremendous Damage to This Country.' \" Tough but fair.\n\nQuestions about his temperament and maturity will heat up after the documentary on O'Rourke's Senate campaign. It \"presents a less-than-fawning look at O'Rourke -- a candidate who got nervous before speaking to huge crowds or debating Cruz, who lashed out at his overworked employees, who acknowledged on election night that he had often been a 'giant' jerk on the campaign trail, who had a complicated relationship with his own father and nonetheless thrust his young children into the spotlight.\" Let's see if he gets treated as harshly as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) has turned up the heat on Trump repeatedly. \"Let's face it: This president and this administration give me a lot of reasons to be vocal and visible. And I think it's really important at a time like this for people to see a face like mine, which is obviously a minority face.\"\n\nWait nine or 10 months until the Iowa campaigns heat up. For now: \"Joe Biden has yet to enter the 2020 presidential race -- he's been weighing the decision in a closely watched will-he-or-won't-he saga -- but the former vice president still leads the pack in Iowa.\"\n\nThe prime minister takes heat for putting party over country. \"For more than two years, British Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to balance the needs of her country, as she negotiates its exit from the European Union, with that of her party, wherein a fiercely Eurosceptic wing has limited her ability to compromise. Now, with Brexit fast approaching at the end of the month, and May's attempts at an amicable divorce lacking parliamentary support, the prime minister can choose to delay the withdrawal, currently set for March 29, or lead Britain out of the EU with no deal, which detractors say could leave the country without food, without medicine, without international travel.\" Read the whole thing.\n\nHenry Olsen: Trump has given North Korea a valuable bargaining chip for free\n\nJennifer Rubin: What to watch for when Biden and Beto launch\n\nChristine Emba: Cutting Fox News off from Democratic debates will backfire\n\nWashington Post Opinions: 2020 hopefuls are hopping off the fence.

He was in the corner in front of the Miami bench early in the fourth quarter, no Heat defenders within 10 feet of him, and made as open a 3-pointer as one can find in an NBA game.\n\nThey all weren't that easy for Toronto.\n\nBut the Raptors made a lot of them look that way.\n\nLowry scored 24 points, and the Raptors tied a franchise record by making 21 3-pointers while rolling past the Heat 125-104 on Sunday. Half of Lowry's 10 assists set up 3s for the Raptors -- who became the 19th team this season to set or tie a franchise mark for 3s in a game.\n\n\"Good weather. The body was warm. It definitely helps,\" Lowry said. \"But we just came out with a composed mentality. We knew who were going up against and those guys are hard to play.\"\n\nThe 3-pointer was the difference. Toronto made 42 field goals, exactly the same as Miami. The Raptors had seven more turnovers. The Heat had five more bench points.\n\nToronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry (7) shoots over Miami Heat forward Kelly Olynyk during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, March 10, 2019, in Miami. (Lynne Sladky/Associated Press)\n\nThese are not the makings of a 21-point win.\n\nThe 63-24 edge in scoring from beyond the arc, that was too much for Miami to overcome.\n\n\"You could tell they prepared for us,\" Miami's Dwyane Wade said. \"They prepared for our zone. They did things that teams normally don't do in the zone and they made shots out of it. So kudos to them for coming in with a great game plan and executing it.\"\n\nDanny Green scored 15 points, all on 3-pointers.

    "title": "What Triggers Ice Ages?",
    "body": "During the past billion years, the Earth's climate has fluctuated between warm periods -- sometimes even completely ice-free -- and cold periods, when glaciers scour the continents. In this article, climate scientist Kirk Maasch offers perspective on these historic changes, including the likely causes of the last great ice age -- which contrary to common knowledge, we are still in the midst of.\n\nIce ages are times when the entire Earth experiences notably colder climatic conditions. During an ice age, the polar regions are cold, there are large differences in temperature from the equator to the pole, and large, continental-size glaciers can cover enormous regions of the Earth.\n\nEver since the Pre-Cambrian (600 million years ago), ice ages have occurred at widely spaced intervals of geologic time -- approximately 200 million years -- lasting for millions, or even tens of millions of years. For the Cenozoic period, which began about 70 million years ago and continues today, evidence derived from marine sediments provide a detailed, and fairly continuous, record for climate change. This record indicates decreasing deep-water temperature, along with the build-up of continental ice sheets. Much of this deep-water cooling occurred in three major steps about 36, 15 and 3 million years ago -- the most recent of which continues today.\n\nDuring the present ice age, glaciers have advanced and retreated over 20 times, often blanketing North America with ice. Our climate today is actually a warm interval between these many periods of glaciation. The most recent period of glaciation, which many people think of as the \"Ice Age,\" was at its height approximately 20,000 years ago.\n\nAlthough the exact causes for ice ages, and the glacial cycles within them, have not been proven, they are most likely the result of a complicated dynamic interaction between such things as solar output, distance of the Earth from the sun, position and height of the continents, ocean circulation, and the composition of the atmosphere.\n\nBetween 52 and 57 million years ago, the Earth was relatively warm. Tropical conditions actually extended all the way into the mid-latitudes (around northern Spain or the central United States for example), polar regions experienced temperate climates, and the difference in temperature between the equator and pole was much smaller than it is today. Indeed it was so warm that trees grew in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and alligators lived in Ellesmere Island at 78 degrees North.\n\nBut this warm period, called the Eocene, was followed by a long cooling trend. Between 52 and 36 million years ago, ice caps developed in East Antarctica, reaching down to sea level in some places. Close to Antarctica, the temperature of the water near the surface dropped to between 5 and 8 degrees Celsius. Between 36 and 20 million years ago the Earth experienced the first of three major cooling steps. At this time a continental-scale temperate ice sheet emerged in East Antarctica. Meanwhile, in North America, the mean annual air temperature dropped by approximately 12 degrees Celsius.\n\nWe are still in the midst of the third major cooling period that began around 3 million years ago.\n\nBetween 20 and 16 million years ago, there was a brief respite from the big chill, but this was followed by a second major cooling period so intense that by 7 million years ago southeastern Greenland was completely covered with glaciers, and by 5-6 million years ago, the glaciers were creeping into Scandinavia and the northern Pacific region. The Earth was once more released from the grip of the big chill between 5 and 3 million years ago, when the sea was much warmer around North America and the Antarctic than it is today. Warm-weather plants grew in Northern Europe where today they cannot survive, and trees grew in Iceland, Greenland, and Canada as far north as 82 degrees North.\n\nWe are still in the midst of the third major cooling period that began around 3 million years ago, and its effect can be seen around the world, perhaps even in the development of our own species. Around 2 and a half million years ago, tundra-like conditions took over north-central Europe. Soon thereafter, the once-humid environment of Central China was replaced by harsh continental steppe. And in sub-Saharan Africa, arid and open grasslands expanded, replacing more wooded, wetter environments. Many paleontologists believe that this environmental change is linked to the evolution of humankind.\n\nClimate change on ultra-long time scales (tens of millions of years) are more than likely connected to plate tectonics. Plate motions lead to cycles of ocean basin growth and destruction, known as Wilson cycles, involving continental rifting, seafloor-spreading, subduction, and collision. Several explanations of the latest cooling trend that involve a climate-tectonic connection are summarized below.\n\nThrough the course of a Wilson cycle continents collide and split apart, mountains are uplifted and eroded, and ocean basins open and close. The re-distribution and changing size and elevation of continental land masses may have caused climate change on long time scales. Computer climate models have shown that the climate is very sensitive to changing geography. It is unlikely, however, that these large variations in the Earth's geography were the primary cause of the latest long-term cooling trend as they fail to decrease temperatures on a global scale.\n\nLikewise, changing topography cannot, by itself, explain this cooling trend. Computer model experiments performed to test the climate's sensitivity to mountains and high plateaus show that plateau uplift in Tibet and western North America has a small effect on global temperature but cannot explain the magnitude of the cooling trend. Plateau uplift does, however, have a significant impact on climate, including the diversion of North Hemisphere westerly winds and intensification of monsoonal circulation.\n\nAnother theory explaining these changes in climate involves the opening and closing of gateways for the flow of ocean currents. This theory suggests that the redistribution of heat on the planet by changing ocean circulation can isolate polar regions, cause the growth of ice sheets and sea ice, and increase temperature differences between the equator and the poles.\n\nOcean modeling experiments suggest that the ocean could not have carried enough heat to the poles to maintain the early warm climates. But atmospheric climate modeling experiments show that even if the ocean did transport enough heat up to the coast of Antarctica to maintain sea surface temperatures at 10 to 15 degrees Celsius, the interior conditions would still be much colder -- and this is contrary to the geologic record. It is possible, however, that changes in heat transport caused by variations in ocean gateways may have played a significant role in cooling trends over the last 60 million years, and, in particular, may help explain some of the relatively sudden cooling events.\n\nChanges in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are a strong candidate to explain the overall pattern of climatic change. Carbon dioxide influences the mean global temperature through the greenhouse effect. The globally averaged surface temperature for the Earth is approximately 15 degrees Celsius, and this is due largely to the greenhouse effect. Solar radiation entering earth's atmosphere is predominantly short wave, while heat radiated from the Earth's surface is long wave. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere absorb this long wave radiation. Because the Earth does not allow this long wave radiation to leave, the solar energy is trapped and the net effect is to warm the Earth. If not for the presence of an atmosphere, the surface temperature on earth would be well below the freezing point of water.\n\nThrough a million year period, the average amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is affected by four fluxes: flux of carbon due to (1) metamorphic degassing, (2) weathering of organic carbon, (3) weathering of silicates, (4) burial of organic carbon. Degassing reactions associated with volcanic activity and the combining of organic carbon with oxygen release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Conversely, the burial of organic matter removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nPlate collisions disrupt these carbon fluxes in a variety of ways, some tending to elevate and some tending to lower the atmospheric carbon dioxide level. It has been suggested that the Eocene, the early warm trend 55 million years ago, was caused by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and that a subsequent decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide led to the cooling trend over the past 52 million years. One mechanism proposed as a cause of this decrease in carbon dioxide is that mountain uplift lead to enhanced weathering of silicate rocks, and thus removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nIn addition, the collision of India and Asia led to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas. While topography may not be enough to explain the cooling trends, another mechanism may account for changing climate. The uplift may have caused both an increase in the global rate of chemical erosion, as well as erode fresh minerals that are rapidly transported to lower elevations, which are warmer and moister and allow chemical weathering to happen more efficiently. Through these mechanisms, then, it has been hypothesized that the tectonically driven uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas is the prime cause of the post-Eocene cooling trend.",

    "title": "Hurricane Power",
    "body": "Fact: The total energy released through cloud and rain formation in an average hurricane is equivalent to 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity.\n\nThis astonishing fact comes by way of Christopher Landsea, a hurricane expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But how can atmospheric scientists possibly know how much energy a hurricane gives off? Obviously there's no thermometer big enough to measure the heat energy of a urikan, or \"big wind,\" as the Carib Indians who gave us the word knew them.\n\nFirst you have to know how much rain comes down in your average hurricane (never mind why for the moment). For over 2,000 years, people measured rainfall with rain gauges. But bowls placed in the rain won't cut it for a hurricane. Fortunately, weather radars can. By bouncing electromagnetic radiation off rain or ice and calculating how much energy is returned, radars can give fairly accurate estimates of rainfall rates. A weather radar aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite can now do this across an entire hurricane.\n\nNow for a few calculations. In 1981, William Gray, the nation's leading hurricane forecaster, published a paper stating that an average hurricane produces a little over half an inch of rain a day within a circular area 825 miles across. If you convert this to a volume of rain, Landsea notes, you get about 1.3 x 10\n\nNow, to figure how much energy is discharged when all that rain is produced, you have to use the so-called \"latent heat of condensation.\" When water vapor cools sufficiently, it condenses into water droplets. Think of a cold can of soda on a hot day: water droplets appear on the outside because the thin layer of air surrounding the can is being cooled enough that all the water vapor in that layer condenses out. During that condensation process, it turns out, latent (stored) heat is given off.\n\nWhen tropical meteorologists calculate using the latent heat of condensation, they find that the condensation of those 22 million Olympic pools worth of rain results in the release of 600 trillion watts of heat energy -- or 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity as of January 1, 1996, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures.\n\nFortunately for those in the path of hurricanes, most of this energy goes into generating the storm's rising motions or gets expelled as a kind of \"cold exhaust\" in the upper layers of the atmosphere, some eight or ten miles up. Only a tiny portion of that total energy goes into cooking up the ferocious winds. \"A hurricane is a pretty inefficient heat engine,\" Landsea says. \"Only about a half percent of all the energy that's being released is actually captured by the hurricane to warm the air locally, lower the pressure, and spin the winds out.\"\n\nYet as people in, say, Florida know all too well, that half percent still packs a wallop. Like 1,500,000,000,000 watts in the average hurricane -- or fully half of the global electrical output.",

    "title": "How to Get an Atmosphere",
    "body": "Why just these four? Why not also Mercury, or Jupiter's biggest moons, or our own moon? How did those lucky four come by their atmospheres?\n\nIt turns out that getting an atmosphere, and holding on to it, really comes down to how big and how close to the sun you are -- or, for Titan, how close you are to a really big planet. For astrophysicists, it's infinitely more complex than that. But if you just want the quick and dirty answer, that's it, and here's why:\n\nThe story of planetary atmospheres begins back at the beginning of our solar system, when the planets were forming. During that period, the so-called inner planets -- Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars -- all developed the same kind of air, a so-called primary atmosphere. It consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium, the two elements that today make up 98 percent of the sun and gas giants like Jupiter.\n\nLike planet-sized magnets, the proto-planets had sufficient gravity to draw these two gaseous elements in from the solar nebula, the vast cloud of gas and dust that surrounded the sun early in the solar system's history. In that primordial time, the sun was not very bright and thus not very hot, and this allowed the four inner planets to hold onto those atmospheres.\n\nThree factors play into a gas's ability to escape the pull of a planet's gravity: temperature, molecular mass, and escape velocity, the speed a molecule needs to achieve to escape into space. Hotter, lighter, and faster particles more easily slip out of a planet's gravitational grip into space than cooler, heavier, and slower particles.\n\nHydrogen and helium are two of the lightest molecular-weight molecules out there. And as the sun grew brighter and hotter, the molecules of hydrogen and helium that the four inner planets had been able to retain became hotter and faster, finally reaching escape velocity. When that happened, perhaps within a few hundred million years after the formation of the inner planets, these gases escaped into space, leaving Earth and its three companions little more than balls of rock in space.\n\nThe four giant outer planets, meanwhile -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune -- were able to keep their hydrogen and helium because of their size. Their gravitational pull is mighty enough to contain those two light gases, and the sun is too far away for its heat to make any difference. So those four gas giants still host their primary atmospheres.\n\nFortunately for us, there are secondary atmospheres, otherwise we wouldn't be here. These are atmospheres that arise long after a planet's primary atmosphere has vanished into the ether. Yet not all rocky bodies have the means to sustain them. Mercury, for one, is too close to the sun to hold onto any type of gas. So how did the four solid bodies that have them win the atmospheric lottery?\n\nLeaving Titan aside for the moment, Earth, Mars, and Venus all began developing their secondary atmospheres in the same way. Over time their envelopes of air would become as unlike as heaven and hell -- in the case of Earth and Venus, for example -- but initially they likely appeared largely the same. The reason is that, despite their differences today, these three planets lie in roughly the same neighborhood of the solar system and are thought to consist of roughly the same mix of elementary stuff.\n\nEarth became heavenly, Mars froze solid, and all hell broke loose on Venus. What happened?\n\nWhile Earth, Mars, and Venus eventually got to the point where they could no longer embrace hydrogen and helium, they did have sufficient gravity and cool enough surface temperatures to retain heavier molecular-weight gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor. And they had plenty of these two substances stored away in one form or another within their stony bodies. The CO and HO came from two sources: the original building blocks out of which the planets formed as well as comets that regularly slammed into the planets early in their history.\n\nFortunately, again, for us, these crucial substances of CO and HO -- and also nitrogen, which comprises 78 percent of our atmosphere -- were not irretrievably locked in the rocks. These substances had a catalyst that helped free them: heat. Within each planet, a molten core created during the planet's initial formation released heat, and so did the slow decay of radioactive elements deep beneath the surface. This heat kept each planet toasty enough to produce volcanic eruptions, which spewed these gases out of the interior.\n\nDespite increased warmth from the sun, these heavier molecules could not escape the gravity of Earth, Mars, and Venus, respectively, and so they began building up just above each planet's surface. The result was a secondary atmosphere -- or what most of us know simply as the air.\n\nBut, in time, Earth became heavenly, Mars froze solid, and all hell broke loose on Venus. What happened?\n\nThis is where the how-close-you-are-to-the-sun part comes in. On Earth, all that water vapor belched out of volcanoes condensed in the young atmosphere into liquid water, then fell to the surface as rain. Over eons, this formed the oceans. Most of the CO, meanwhile, became incorporated into the seas and into sedimentary rocks. Most, but not all, and this is crucial. Enough CO remained as gas in the atmosphere to create the greenhouse effect, which maintains our planet at a life-sustaining average global temperature of about 59\u00b0F. Everything eased into a wonderful balance, all brought about by our ideal distance from the sun.\n\nAs for Mars, its secondary atmosphere had two strikes against it from the start: the planet's size (too small) and its distance from the sun (too far). In its first 500 million years or so, the Red Planet had a warm atmosphere and liquid-water oceans, just like Earth. But Mars is so small that its internal heat engine burned out early on, and it is so far away from the sun that all the water vapor that its once-active volcanoes had erupted eventually froze out of the atmosphere, becoming trapped beneath the surface as ice. All this left the Red Planet as cold and barren and apparently lifeless as the moon. Mars still has an atmosphere, but its pressure is 100 times less than Earth's and it's almost entirely composed of CO -- about the last thing we'd want to breathe.\n\nVenus has roughly the same concentration of CO as Mars, yet its atmosphere went in precisely the opposite direction. Size wasn't an issue: Venus has about the same mass as Earth so is plenty hot within. But distance from the sun has made all the difference. Venus is near enough to our star that all the water vapor released from its volcanoes burned off long ago, and without liquid water, the planet could not form oceans that could absorb the CO.\n\nThe result has been a runaway greenhouse effect. While a greenhouse effect raises the temperature of Mars by about 5\u00b0F and Earth by about 35\u00b0F, on Venus it has jacked up the temperature by around 500\u00b0F. The resulting atmosphere is truly nasty from our perspective: hotter than a self-cleaning oven, with a density about 10 percent that of water and a pressure about what you'd feel a half-mile down in the ocean.\n\nAnd what about Titan? Why did it get an atmosphere when, for example, none of Jupiter's big moons, which are a lot closer to the sun, did? Well, in this case, distance from the sun doesn't really come into it; the moons of the outer planets are so far away that it's a moot point. But distance does factor in -- distance to a giant planet. And, again, size matters. In fact, a moon needs the right balance of nearness to a giant neighbor and adequate gravity -- that is, size -- to gain and hold an atmosphere, and of all the moons in the solar system, only on Titan did Nature strike that balance.\n\nClearly atmospheres can change drastically -- look at Mars.\n\nTitan is close enough to Saturn that it gets squeezed by tidal forces powerful enough to heat up its interior. So the volcanic activity that long ago died out, for instance, on our similarly sized moon has continued there. That activity releases CO and water vapor, but since Titan's mean surface temperature is -289\u00b0F, both of those quickly fall out as ice on the surface. That leaves nitrogen, which remains a gas at that temperature, and methane, which builds up in an interaction between sunlight and CO ice. The result is an atmosphere that is roughly 90 percent nitrogen and 7 percent methane. (Interestingly, as radically different as Titan's atmosphere is to our own, it is still worlds closer in composition and pressure to Earth's nitrogen-rich air than are the CO-dominant atmospheres of either Mars or Venus.)\n\nSaturn makes Titan's gases come out; Titan's size ensures some of them stick around in an atmosphere. Jupiter's moon Io, being so close to its humungous neighbor, has plenty of volcanic activity, but the moon's mass is too small to wield the kind of gravity needed to maintain a hold on the gases that gush out of its insides.\n\nSome atmospheric scientists say that the different tacks the four terrestrials with atmospheres took should offer a cautionary tale to us as we unintentionally monkey with ours. By burning fossil fuels, we are releasing far more CO into the atmosphere than Nature has done anytime in the recent geologic past -- an atmosphere that has been likened in thinness to a dollar bill wrapped around a standard-sized globe. This may upset the exquisite equilibrium between carbon in the air and carbon in the rocks and seas that our planet has maintained to one degree or another for billions of years, with unknown but potentially dire consequences.\n\nClearly atmospheres can change drastically -- look at Mars. Whether we humans could ever severely or permanently alter our own atmosphere is unknown, but some experts are now asking, Do we really want to take that chance?",

    "title": "Life in the Solar System",
    "body": "NOVA: When were the plumes on Enceladus dicovered, and before the flybys began did you expect to find anything like that?\n\nCarolyn Porco: There's been a lot of confusion about this. People seem to think that we were completely surprised to discover that Enceladus had any geysering activity at all, and that's not true. Going back all the way to the Voyager mission, and even prior, people were trying to figure out how Saturn's E Ring, in which Enceladus was clearly embedded, formed. There were various ideas for that. One was that the moon was being hit by high-energy particles that ended up releasing tiny ice grains into orbit around Saturn. But there was some speculation that it could perhaps be geysering coming from the moon -- literally water droplets that were frozen and came off the moon with such energy that they escaped the gravity field of Enceladus and went into orbit around Saturn to form the E Ring.\n\n\"We now strongly suspect that the jets are coming from liquid water.\"\n\nWe had observations planned so we could look to see if Enceladus had any geysers. And, in fact, some of the very, very early observations in which the geysers -- or the jets, as I call them -- were first seen had been given a title with the word plume in it, because these particular observations were planned to search for any material directly coming off the surface of the moon. Also, one of the papers we wrote summarizing our goals for the imaging experiment at Saturn -- which should have been published long before we got into orbit, but we were busy so it didn't get published until about 2004 -- contained a statement that I deliberately put in that paper that said, \"Enceladus could be the Europa of Saturn.\" That was my way of saying that Enceladus could provide that kind of excitement and be the astrobiologically interesting moon of Saturn.\n\nIt has not been found on Europa -- we even looked when Cassini flew by Jupiter in December 2000 but didn't find any. However, realize that geysering will be more unlikely on Europa because it's a larger moon with stronger gravity, and it would be harder for liquid droplets to reach the surface. But Europa turns out to be the moon in the Jovian system that was first realized to have a body of water in its interior. We suspected that there might be something of this ilk on Enceladus, and the first discovery that there were jets or plumes coming off Enceladus were our images in January and February 2005. We now strongly suspect that the jets are coming from liquid water.\n\nIn our images we see icy particles. Other instruments, like the ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, can measure the abundance of water vapor coming off the south polar cap. And if you take the mass in icy particles that we see and compare it to the mass in the vapor that that instrument sees, the abundance of icy particles is more than you would expect if this whole phenomenon were arising from sublimating ice. You would expect fewer particles, fewer solids if it were coming from sublimating ice. So by default the next possibility is that it's coming from liquid water.\n\nAnother really fantastic piece of evidence that's very hard to refute is the presence of salt in these particles. There's so much salt there that it could only be that the solids were previously droplets of salty water and then got frozen. If, instead, it were coming from ice that had salt in it, the salt would generally be left behind when the molecules leave the surface of the ice. You wouldn't expect to see the kind of saltiness that we see if it was sublimating ice.\n\nThere is other evidence more along the lines of the models that people have proposed for how you get heat coming out of Enceladus. These models suggest pockets, or a whole regional sea, of liquid water under the south pole. So it's becoming harder and harder to escape the conclusion that there's a body of liquid water within Enceladus.\n\nWe've investigated various possibilities. Outside of Titan, Enceladus has more rock within it relative to its size than any other moon in the Saturn system. But despite the fact that it's, whatever it is -- 60 percent rocky by mass -- there's not enough rock there to make radioactivity a plausible explanation for all the heat that we see coming out of Enceladus. It's way off. You can't do it with radioactivity alone. So the only other plausible mechanism left is tidal flexure. Because Enceladus is in an eccentric orbit as it goes around Saturn -- sometimes it's close to Saturn, then it's farther away, then it's close again -- this periodic change in its distance from Saturn means that the tidal bulge raised in the body of Enceladus by Saturn also changes in magnitude. If you think about it, that means that the body of Enceladus is being flexed, and if it's being flexed that means there's internal friction, and internal friction leads to heat.\n\nNow, in truth, the amount of heat that we see coming out of Enceladus at this very moment is even more than we can explain with the present-day flexing. So it really becomes interesting because then you have to say, okay, Enceladus must have had an even larger eccentricity in the past and its flexure was even greater, and so the heat production at that time was greater than what we see now. But all that energy must have been stored in the interior of Enceladus and only now is it making its way to the surface where we can measure it. So we think today we're seeing the energy stored in the interior of Enceladus over the course of its past. How far in the past we're not really sure.\n\nIt could be. There are two big questions. Are we seeing a monotonic decrease in heat output, with Enceladus getting colder and colder with time so that eventually all the liquid freezes and it becomes entirely solid and it never can get warm enough again to become liquid? Or is it in a cycle? It's orbital eccentricity gets very high, a lot of heat is produced, and then it starts to cool off. There's still a lot of heat coming out of it, and that stored heat takes a while before it all comes out. But it never loses so much heat that it becomes completely solid. Then it goes through a phase where its orbital eccentricity increases again. So its orbital eccentricity increases, decreases, increases, decreases, and all that cycling makes the heat coming out of Enceladus vary over time. But it never gets completely frozen. Those are some of the models that are being proposed now.\n\n\"The question is, has the liquid persisted long enough for life to even get started?\"\n\nEveryone studying Enceladus right now is getting better at what they're doing. The people who have the data in their hands are getting better at analyzing it, getting more familiar with what it means. The same applies to the modelers, the people who've been thinking about the interior of Enceladus. Their models are getting more and more sophisticated, and they're pushing them farther and farther. They are now coming to the conclusion that it is very possible a regional sea beneath the south pole of Enceladus never freezes entirely, and that it can be in this cyclical behavior. So that means there's always some liquid water under the south pole.\n\nWe haven't gotten that far. The question is, has the liquid persisted long enough for life to even get started? And that brings up another issue, the collision of two ideas really. One is, how long does the liquid in Enceladus persist, and the other is, how long does it take life to develop? Just playing devil's advocate someone might say, well, you might have liquid water there, but you don't know that it's been there long enough for life to develop because life might have taken hundreds of millions of years. Maybe the liquid water only persisted tens of millions of years. Now, we suspect, as I've already said, that the liquid water probably persists there indefinitely.\n\nBut this brings up the issue, how long does it take for life to develop? Based on the record on the Earth for life to develop we think the maximum is on the order of a few hundred million years, maybe 300 million years. That's the time separation between the appearance of the first fossilized organisms and the end of what we call the Late Heavy Bombardment, when the conditions on the surface of the Earth would have been hellish because big chunks of solid material were still raining down on the Earth. After this Late Heavy Bombardment was over, the conditions on the surface of the Earth became quiescent and stable enough for life to get started and not get wiped out by some large impact. It's at that point, we believe, that life took a firm foothold on our planet. But all this doesn't mean that life did, in fact, take as long as a few hundred million years to develop. That's the upper limit. The lower limit could have been much lower: It could have been 10 million years. We just don't know.\n\n\"Science fiction writers can get as crazy as they want, but we can't get too crazy or we'll wreck our reputations.\"\n\nThere isn't very much data. So the arguments that the liquid water on Enceladus might not have been there long enough for life to get started is important to consider. But there's no evidence to say what the shortest time period for life to develop on the Earth is, so we can put that argument on hold. The models indicate that it's very likely that liquid water does persist under the south pole of Enceladus. So life could have firmly taken hold on Enceladus. There could have easily been enough time. Even if the ocean or the sea on Enceladus lasts only a few hundred million years, if life only took 10 million years to get started, it could have gotten started there.\n\nSure it does. We've been so slow to realize these things. It's kind of been a failure of imagination. Scientists don't go off and think completely wild and crazy things unless they have some evidence that leads them to that. It's almost like our contract says that we're not supposed to do that. Science fiction writers can get as crazy as they want, but we can't get too crazy or we'll wreck our reputations.\n\nBut once we know how much heat tidal flexing can produce, that means that anywhere there's tidal flexing and you have a body that's made largely of water ice -- or a good fraction of it is water ice -- you can have this situation of internal liquid. The other ingredients for life -- the presence of organic materials and a continuous supply of the right kind of chemicals that organic-based organisms would want to consume -- is pretty common. We have that on Enceladus. It's pretty widespread throughout the solar system, and it's probably pretty widespread throughout the cosmos. So the answer to your question is, yes, this really has broadened our view of what kinds of environments we might find biotic chemistry in.\n\nThe discovery of organic materials came from an instrument called the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, which was originally put on the spacecraft to sample the upper atmosphere of Titan. This instrument literally scoops up the atmosphere, takes it into its internal chambers, and can measure the mass of the molecule. And by having a mass spectrum of the constituents it has scooped up, it can identify what kind of molecules are there.\n\nThe instrument was pressed into service as soon as we realized that there was a plume of material coming off Enceladus, and it has found water vapor and simple organic compounds and traces of ammonia and other astrobiologically interesting compounds, very likely formaldehyde and propane and hydrogen cyanide and so on.\n\nEverywhere you look in the interstellar medium astronomers find organic compounds. They find, for example, amino acids. We even find amino acids in meteorites right here in our solar system. The basic building blocks of life are present. It's sort of ordinary. It should not be surprising that we find organic materials in the outer solar system. The question is, do they go on to form more complex chains, like complex proteins or the long molecules that can encode instructions for building living organisms? When and where do those things happen? We don't know if any of those complex molecules exist on Enceladus because Cassini is not equipped to search for those kinds of ingredients. Some of us are hoping that we can soon go back with a spacecraft to Enceladus to properly sample the plumes, perhaps land on the surface, take seismic measurements to listen for the rumblings of a subterranean geysers and so on. There's a lot we could do if we had the opportunity to go back.\n\nSo Enceladus has all the ingredients that we knew were basic to this question of a habitable zone. It's got liquid water as far as we know, and it definitely has organic compounds. It also has excess heat up the wazoo, more heat than we know what to do with. And the fact that we see salt in the solid particles tells us that the subterranean liquid is in contact with rock. That means that it's kind of like these environments miles beneath the surface of the Earth where you have hot water flowing across hot volcanic rocks. So there's enough heat, you have water leeching important compounds out of the rock, and there are organisms that eat things like sulfur and hydrogen. They don't require sunlight. They don't even require anything that's been made by sunlight. So those are the analogous ecologies we think of when we imagine what kind of organisms could possibly exist under the surface of Enceladus.\n\nTo me, everything we have found with Cassini really makes the case to go to Enceladus first, above any other place in the solar system, if you're in a hurry to investigate a habitable zone. Enceladus seems to have all the things that people have known about, or thought to look for, in asking the question, did life get started elsewhere in our solar system? And it doesn't take a whole lot of speculation to say we could literally have organisms living under the surface of Enceladus, maybe even shot out in these ice particles. Because we know of ecologies right now, living under the surface of the Earth, that could live, could persist, could survive in this sea under the south pole of Enceladus.\n\nPeople will say, well, we might have life on the surface of Titan. But any life living in the pools of liquid hydrocarbons on the surface of Titan is complete speculation because we don't know of any organisms living now on the surface of the Earth, or within it, that could survive in the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan, because the temperatures there are way, way, way too cold. To say that the lakes on Titan are places where we could have living organisms is much farther along the axis of speculation than our statements about the possible presence of life on Enceladus.\n\n\"With Enceladus, accessibility is the operative word. All you have to do is sample the plumes, and you've got what you came for.\"\n\nOn Cassini we can only measure the masses of compounds up to a certain limit. If any compound were much more massive, the Cassini instrument would not be able to detect it. So we would want to take a more capable Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, one that could measure far heavier molecules so that we could see if there are any, and what kind of molecules they are. That's just one kind of experiment.\n\nYou can also measure what's called chirality. Chirality is a fancy word for handedness. It's the difference between the way your left hand and your right hand are configured. Organisms on the surface of Earth preferentially use molecules of only one handedness. So if you came across a soup of biologically interesting molecules, and you sampled and found the chirality was 50/50 -- half was one handedness, half was the other -- you would be pressed to conclude that there's no living organisms of the type we know of, because a soup of Earthly-type organisms wouldn't look like this. But if you found preferentially one handedness and not the other, then you know that there's some process driving that handedness out of equilibrium, and one very plausible explanation would be living organisms. You could test for that. By the way, those are simple measurements to make. You don't have to invent any new wild-and-crazy and currently unavailable instrument to make those measurements. We could do that right now.\n\nI wax on excitedly about this all the time. When you talk about this you have to always issue the caveat that what we have on Enceladus right now is extraordinarily exciting and encouraging, but it does not mean that there are living organisms there. It just means that it is right now the go-to place in our solar system for examining a habitable zone. And with Enceladus, accessibility is the operative word. All you have to do is sample the plumes and you've got what you came for. You don't have to drill 10 kilometers under the surface, like you would on Europa, which incidentally will never happen in our lifetime. Unless they find some kind of jetting activity on Europa, we'll never in our lifetime get up close and personal with the ocean there.\n\nOn Mars they're talking about possibly finding fossilized life. I've heard it said that the most likely place for living organisms would be under the polar icecaps. But then you'd have to dig under the icecaps to get to them. Titan surface life, as I've said, is just pure speculation. So Enceladus is the best place to go in our solar system right now to ask the question, did life get started anywhere else?\n\nIf you had living organisms that were forcing a system out of its chirality equilibrium and all those organisms died, eventually over time you would expect it to revert back to being 50/50. I'm not an astrobiologist, but I would venture to say that if you found a system that was out of equilibrium, then you could and would conclude that there were living organisms there now. I think that's how the logic would go.\n\nI would imagine that if you got single-celled organisms going you could get evolution going, if it works like life has worked on Earth. But that's why we're so incredibly interested in this, because we don't know! We don't even know if life originating in water would end up looking like earthly life. That's why we want to go. That's what's so intriguing about this question. We only have a statistic of one right now, and it would help enormously to have another example.\n\nIf you're paying attention to what's going on regarding NASA right now, there's a lot of consternation. The JWST [James Webb Space Telescope] looks like it's going to eat everybody's lunch unless Congress gives it extra money. And I don't realistically see that happening. And, of course, the general state of the country's finances also puts us and everybody else in a tremendous state of uncertainty. I can't answer anything about timelines.\n\nI don't think that's an issue. In our local neighborhood astronomers are discovering planetary systems all the time. I can't keep up with the numbers of them. I think there's several hundred by now discovered by ground-based observers. And Kepler [a NASA mission to look for planets beyond our solar system] is discovering many more, and they vary in how they look -- that is, the distribution of the planets and the sizes of the planets. But what we're finding is more or less what we've always suspected, that there's nothing at all unusual about our solar system: that there are very likely planets that look like Jupiter, and like Saturn with its rings, like Uranus tilted on its side, and like Earth covered in water, and probably lots of examples of types of planets that aren't represented in our solar system.\n\nOf course, if we ever discover that genesis has occurred independently twice in our solar system, no matter where we find it, then that means that the spell has been broken, the existence theorem has been proven, and we could infer from that that life is not a bug but a feature of the universe in which we live, and has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the 13.7 billion-year history of the universe.\n\nAnd that would be a huge scientific result. I don't think there'd be any question about it. It probably wouldn't be the socially cataclysmic event that the discovery of intelligent life would be. But scientifically it would be a radically phenomenal event.\n\nThe way I feel about it, we should go to Enceladus. We should go directly to Enceladus, we should not pass Go, we should not collect $200. It's that simple.",

    "title": "Joe Trivelli's crunchy Italian recipes",
    "body": "Got some old bread in the larder? Then you're halfway to making some delicious classic dishes\n\nThere's been a lot of old bread knocking about our place since my New Year's resolution to bake a loaf of rye bread a week. Luckily, I find it hard not to put breadcrumbs - briciole in Italian - on everything anyhow. I love that crunch. Pasta - even pizza - with briciole... Salad, roast vegetables, whatever. It's the very easiest, laziest way to add a new texture to anything. And the better the bread, the better the crumb: good bread is more inclined to dry out. I remember my uncle running a loaf under the tap - it was so hard it could never have been cut with a knife. He crumbled it incrementally for an excellent panzanella. If we need old bread more quickly than it can dry out, we use the oven to speed things up.\n\nPointed cabbage and breadcrumbs\n\nI feel there is no better way with cabbage than how Trine Hahnemann, the Danish cookery writer, and a great friend, cooked it on a cold evening in Copenhagen: fried with a regular and generous basting of butter. Here you get a soothing dairy hit with butter and cream, but with some body from the tomatoes and the punch of chilli. For this recipe, it is essential that the onions have a long gentle cook so that they aren't prominent. Adding the odd tablespoon of water is allowed.\n\nServes 4 as a starter or side dish\n\nred onions 2\n\ngarlic cloves 2\n\nolive oil\n\nplum tomatoes 125g, peeled\n\ndried chilli 1\n\nbreadcrumbs 50g\n\npointed cabbage 1, halved\n\nsingle cream 100ml\n\nbutter 30g\n\nlemon 1\n\nmint 3 sprigs, leaves plucked\n\nHalve and then thinly slice the onions and 1 garlic clove. In a small saucepan, sweat them together with 2 tbsp of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Once they have heated up, turn the temperature to low and allow to sweat for 40 minutes, stirring and checking from time to time.\n\nChop the tomatoes and add them to the onions, turning the heat up to medium and cooking for 10 more minutes.\n\nIn a frying pan, heat 4 tbsp of olive oil with the other sliced garlic clove and the crumbled dried chilli. When the garlic is golden and the chilli dark, add the breadcrumbs, stirring while they crisp for 1-2 minutes. When they look good and burnished, remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Salt a little.\n\nIn a steamer, cook the cabbage over boiling water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small pan, heat the cream until just before boiling, add the butter and salt to taste, and turn off the heat. Add a squeeze of lemon - don't worry if it curdles.\n\nPlace the cabbage on a warm plate. Dress in the cream first - underneath as well - and then dress with the tomatoey onions, then torn mint leaves, some lemon zest and finally the breadcrumbs.\n\nWinter panzanella\n\nThere's nothing traditional about this. Add anchovies if you like.\n\nServes 4 as a starter\n\ncucumber \u00bd, small\n\npumpkin 500g\n\nthyme 2 sprigs\n\nparsley 5 sprigs\n\ngarlic 1 clove\n\nolive oil\n\nsalted capers 2 tbsp, washed\n\nred wine vinegar\n\nradicchio tardivo 1, leaves separated\n\nbaby radicchio 50g, or whatever bitter salad you can find\n\nbaby spinach 50g\n\ncelery heart 1 small, and a few pale leaves\n\nrobust old bread 200g piece, crust removed\n\norganic buttermilk 150ml\n\nSmash the cucumber several times with a rolling pin and pull it apart into a bowl. Season with salt and set aside.\n\nHeat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Peel and cut the pumpkin into smallish pieces. Pound the herbs in a mortar with the garlic clove and a pinch of salt and add a tablespoon of oil. Use a tablespoon of the herb paste to coat the pumpkin pieces before placing on a tray and roasting for 30 minutes, or until just soft.\n\nMix the remaining herb paste with the capers, 2 tbsp of vinegar and 4 tbsp of olive oil. Clean all the salad leaves. Trim the end of the root of the celery and slice the heart thinly.\n\nTear the bread into short shards and drizzle with a tablespoon of oil. Place around the pumpkin and return to the oven for 8 minutes, till golden and crisp.\n\nPlace the bread and pumpkin in a salad bowl, then pour over the buttermilk. Add the herb dressing, the celery and leaves. Turn everything gently to dress.\n\nStuffed onions\n\nServes 4 as a main with something else\n\nbrown onions 8 medium\n\nstale bread 75g, cut into 1cm cubes\n\nwhole milk 75ml\n\nsausages 4 (about 300g total)\n\nthyme 4 sprigs\n\nfresh sage 1 sprig\n\nfresh oregano 1 sprig\n\nfresh rosemary 1 sprig\n\ntaleggio 120g, diced\n\nPreheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Cover the bottom of a small baking pan with coarse salt and add the onions, scattering with a little more salt. Bake for 45 minutes, or until tender. To state the obvious, the larger the onions, the longer they take, so use good judgement. Remove and leave till cool enough to handle.\n\nIn a bowl, sprinkle the bread with milk. Cut the sausages open, remove the meat and add to the bowl. My sausages are garlicky already; if yours aren't, add a chopped clove of garlic, too. Pick the leaves from the herbs and add half of them to the bowl with a twist of pepper.\n\nNow cut the tops off the onions with a serrated knife. Use a teaspoon to remove the insides, leaving but a few layers. Chop the onion insides a little and add to the stuffing, before refilling the onions and baking once more for 15 minutes.\n\nTake the pan out of the oven and turn the heat up to 220C/gas mark 7. Toss the remaining herbs in a little oil and use to top the onions, along with the pieces of cheese. Return the pan to the oven and bake until golden - about 10 minutes.\n\nCoconut tart\n\nServes 6\n\nFor the pastry:\n\nwhite flour 100g\n\nrye flour 50g\n\nsalt a small pinch\n\ngolden caster sugar 60g\n\nbutter 75g, cubed, and extra to butter the tin\n\negg 1\n\nFor the pastry cream:\n\ncoconut cream 400ml\n\nvanilla pod \u00bd, seeds scraped out, the rest reserved for something else\n\nsalt a small pinch\n\negg yolks 3\n\ngolden caster sugar 60g\n\nplain flour 30g\n\nFor the topping:\n\nrye breadcrumbs 70g\n\nsoft brown sugar 60g\n\ndesiccated coconut 70g\n\nlemon zest of 1\n\nsoftened butter 50g\n\negg 1, beaten\n\nMake the pastry by rubbing the flours, salt and sugar into the butter - with your fingers or in a food processor - till it has a breadcrumb-like texture. Add the egg to bring everything together and knead to make a pastry. Wrap and leave to rest in the fridge for half an hour, then roll out and use to line a buttered 20cm tart tin. Rest the lined tin again in the fridge.\n\nHeat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6, then blind bake the tart shell for 20 minutes. I use baking paper and some baking beans to hold the pastry in place.\n\nFor the pastry cream, gently heat the coconut cream in a saucepan with the vanilla seeds and salt. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale. Whisk in the flour to the yolk mix then whisk in a ladle of the warm coconut cream. Whisk the yolk mixture into coconut cream in the pan. Return to the heat and cook over a low heat for 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon all the time. It will thicken almost immediately. Pour straight away into another container, still stirring.\n\nFor the topping, mix the breadcrumbs, sugar and coconut together. Grate in the lemon zest and rub in the butter before incorporating the egg bit by bit. You might not need it all.\n\nPour the pastry cream into the tart shell. Take pieces of the topping mixture, flatten it and place over the top of the cream, to eventually cover it. Do not worry if there appears to be some gaps.\n\nBake for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 180C/gas mark 4 and bake for a further 25 minutes. Remove and allow the tart to completely cool before serving so that the cream has a chance to set.\n\nJoe Trivelli is co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9",

    "title": "NBA Sneaker King Power Rankings: James Harden, Jayson Tatum slide in; LeBron James makes history in new kicks",
    "body": "Vol. 7 is here and the kicks you're seeing on the court are sicker than any point this season\n\nNext time you're watching an NBA game take a few moments and concentrate on the shoes your favorite players are wearing. Chances are that guy is rocking some serious heat because, obviously, he's trying to make a run for the Sneaker King crown. Players are trying to best each other on a nightly basis when it comes to the rare gems they rock on the court and that's more evident now than ever before.\n\nAs the NBA season winds down and the playoffs get closer not only are players trying to help their teams separate themselves in the standings, they're also trying to cement their names as the upper echelon in the sneaker game. Starting with Vol. 7, the race for the crown will only continue to intensify and you'll see the best run of NBA sneakers to date. It's time to get you started: here are this week's best 15 players when it comes to standing out on the hardwood.\n\n15. James Harden (Last week: NR)\n\nRockets star guard James Harden is chasing his second straight MVP award and is breaking scoring records that haven't been dusted off since Wilt Chamberlain dominated the league in the '60s. It won't give him a boost in MVP voting, but Harden has been campaigning in style with the Adidas Harden Vol. 3 on his feet. Harden is the biggest name signed to Adidas and the brand has stocked him with a number of amazing colorways lately. Keep scrolling and check out his recent highlights.\n\n14. Luka Doncic (Last week: 12)\n\nMavericks rookie Luka Doncic has really made an imprint this season as a force on the NBA sneaker scene. Doncic has consistently shown off his creativity with custom kicks, his sneaker knowledge with some vintage Nike retros and now he's riding the wave of the latest low-top kicks Nike has to offer. Whenever he's been on the court lately, Doncic has been caught rocking a pair of Nike Hyperdunk X lows in a number of new and unreleased colorways. He also made frequent use of the Hyperdunk X \"Black History Month\" during the entire month of February, so big props for utilizing that classic colorway.\n\n13. De'Aaron Fox (Last week: NR)\n\nDe'Aaron Fox has been one of the standout players on a Kings team with a real shot to make the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. That accomplishment outshines pretty much anything else this season, but his insane display of kicks on the court comes a close second. Fox is a regular in the Sneaker King Power Rankings, making his fifth appearance here in Vol. 7. His highlights recently include the Nike Kobe 7 \"Year of the Dragon,\" the Nike Kobe 9 \"Red Mamba\" and the Nike KD 7 \"Black History Month.\"\n\n12. Derrick Jones Jr. (Last week: 10)\n\nHeat forward Derrick Jones Jr., aka Airplane Mode, not only has one of the best nicknames in the NBA, he also has one of the most versatile sneaker collections around. Jones always seems to come through with some eye-popping kicks whenever he hits the court and that hasn't changed during the Heat's recent surge. Airplane Mode continues to fly high on the sneaker scene with highlights that include the Nike Kobe 5 in a sleek silver colorway with crimson accents (bottom left below). But what really takes the cake wafer this week is a custom pair of Nike Kobe kicks decorated to look like a Kit Kat package. Sneakers and chocolate are a helluva combination and we approve that message.\n\n11. Kevin Durant (Last week: 15)\n\nWarriors star Kevin Durant has been in his bag lately when it comes to rocking player-exclusive kicks. Not only does Durant show you on a nightly basis that he can do the impossible on the court, he also rubs it in your nose that the kicks he's hooping in you can't touch. In Vol. 6, we showed you the Nike KD 11 \"Texas\" PE that he's been rocking with frequency lately and he still has that pair in his rotation. But what pushes Durant up the rankings this week is another KD 11 PE that he broke out for the first time this season in a matchup against the Celtics. Keep scrolling to check the kicks out.\n\n10. Dwyane Wade (Last week: 13)\n\nDwyane Wade keeps getting asked why he's retiring after this season. Fans, analysts and all of the like can still see that he's a legit hooper even in his 16th season. As far as the Sneaker King Power Rankings are concerned, we'd like to see Father Prime return for selfish purposes because he's simply going out in style. Wade, who's signed to Chinese sportswear company Li Ning, has been absolutely killing the shoe game this season. His highlights lately include two amazing colorways of the Way of Wade 7s. You HAVE to check these out.\n\n9. Jayson Tatum (Last week: NR)\n\nHow blessed is Jayson Tatum? A 21-year-old walking bucket on the court who gets the hookup with the latest Nike Kyrie 5s and is one of the handful of NBA players Nike laced up with their new state-of-the-art self-lacing shoes. Things could definitely be worse for the Celtics stud, and he's taking advantage of all his blessings as of late. Tatum's highlights recently include a brand new colorway of the Nike Kyrie 5 that he broke out on his birthday and his frequent use of the Nike Adapt BB PE decorated in Celtics green.\n\n8. Tobias Harris (Last week: 7)\n\nIn Vol. 6, Tobias Harris came in at the No. 7 spot and we broke down why he's in line for the crown when it comes to the best Nike Kobe line in the league right now. Well, now we're in the thick of things here in Vol. 7 and nothing has changed. Harris broke out a number of new colorways in the modern Nike Kobe line but his biggest highlight came when he broke out the Nike Kobe 7 \"Barcelona,\" a classic colorway that pops out whenever it's brought out of the vault.\n\n7. Isaiah Thomas (Last week: 2)\n\nIsaiah Thomas made his Sneaker King debut last week in Vol. 6 and he's back at it again. Thomas' sneaker game will make him a mainstay in these rankings as the season continues to unfold, so be ready for more heat coming out of Denver. Thomas, like Harris before him, has one of the best Nike Kobe collections in the league and continues to show it off on a nightly basis. His recent highlights include the Nike Kobe 4 \"Fade to Black,\" and a vibrant colorway of the Nike Kobe AD that features a rainbow-like streak around the sole that matched perfectly with the Nuggets' City Edition jerseys.\n\n6. DeMar DeRozan (Last week: 5)\n\nCompleting the trilogy of insane Nike Kobe line collections with Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, who continues to be the player that debuts new colorways from the line on a regular basis. Listen, if Nike keeps sending you the brand new stuff before anyone else it seems like they consider you the king of the Kobe line (please don't let Tobias and Isaiah see this). DeRozan was the talk of the NBA sneaker world when he debuted a brand new colorway of the Nike Kobe 4 Protro against the Hawks in Atlanta. He also broke out the Nike Kobe 4 \"Fade to Black\" this week, which is a crazy run of kicks but just looks like light work for him.\n\n5. Russell Westbrook (Last week: 6)\n\nThunder point guard Russell Westbrook is on an absolute tear with his new signature, the Jordan Why Not Zer0.2. Westbrook seemingly breaks out a couple of new colorways of his kicks per week and they all top the previous in creativity. This week, Westbrook broke out TWO new editions of his kicks and they both made a huge splash within the sneaker community. One pair is vibrant yellow with hints of red and a gum bottom, the other is a more tame colorway with hints of camo print and orange accents. If you don't know, now you know: The Brodie always brings the heat.\n\n4. Kyrie Irving (Last week: 4)\n\nCeltics point guard Kyrie Irving is riding the wave of the succesful Nike Kyrie 5 line and has been breaking out exclusive and new colorways on the regular lately. Irving flashed back to his time in Durham, North Carolina with a pair of Kyrie 5 \"Duke\" PEs, which honestly make us all dream of being a 5-star hooper just to get our hands on those shoes. He kept the momentum coming in an exclusive black and white colorway with a reflective Nike swoosh on the side, one of the more unique colorways to see the hardwood this season. If Uncle Drew keeps this sort of fire coming, he's going to be battling for the crown very soon.\n\n3. Montrezl Harrell (Last week: 3)\n\nMontrezl Harrell seriously likes to keep you guessing with what he's going to wear next on the court. Strictly talking versatility and creativity, Harrell might be able to claim the NBA's best sneaker game. Harrell is the only player in the league that can rock the Nike Zoom Rookie \"Galaxy\" and then follow it up with a pair of And1 shoes that have snakes wrapped around a pair of skulls embroidered on the back. Keep scrolling to get a glimpse of those gems.\n\n2. LeBron James (Last week: 11)\n\nWe knew LeBron James would make a giant leap at some point this season when it comes to his on-court kicks. That moment is now, and the leap was huge. The King continues to break out flashy new colorways from his Nike LeBron 16 line, none better than the LeBron 16 Atmos \"Safari.\" James is also aided by the kicks he wore when he surpassed Michael Jordan on the all-time scoring list in a loss to the Nuggets. James wore his LeBron 16 but these kicks were designed to emulate the iconic Jordan 3 in order to pay homage to M.J. himself. We'll have to stay tuned to see what kicks LeBron rocks when he passes Kobe Bryant in points at some point next season. We'll be waiting.\n\n1: P.J. Tucker (Last week: 1)\n\nYou have to dig deep into the history books -- like into the '60s -- to find the last team that was able to win four consecutive titles in NBA history. We know this isn't the same thing, but in terms of just sheer dominance, P.J. Tucker just completed the four-peat and is in the rarefied air only those throwback Boston Celtics teams can relate to. Tucker is the NBA's shoe king and he shows it off on the regular. He rocks shoes on the court that sneakerheads have only heard about as legends. This week, Tucker's light work of crazy kicks include the Nike Kobe 4 \"Gold Medal,\" a shoe Nike made in 2009 after Bryant helped lead Team USA to a gold medal in the Olympics the year prior. Tucker pushed himself away from the pack with two pairs of Nike ID kicks -- one being the Nike Kyrie 1 and the other the Nike LeBron 10 -- which you have to see to understand the hype. Tucker continues to do things on the regular that make our heads spin and our jaws drop. Can he keep it up? That's a silly question, he's the GOAT.\n\nJust Missed The Cut\n\nThese are the players that are on the brink of making the jump in the Sneaker King Power Rankings: Hawks forward Vince Carter, Cavaliers guard Jordan Clarkson, Warriors guard Stephen Curry, Jazz forward Thabo Sefolosha, Thunder forward Jerami Grant and Nuggets guard Malik Beasley.",

    "title": "Chef Miguel Trinidad is putting Filipino food on the map",
    "body": "Born in New York to a family from the Dominican Republic, Miguel Trinidad started working in the hospitality industry as a delivery boy but found his way into the kitchen, and went on to culinary school and jobs as an executive chef.\n\nThen he met Nicole Ponseca, a Filipino native, and on a backpacking trip through her homeland, fell for its multicultural cuisine. They went on to open two critically acclaimed restaurants, Maharlika and Jeepney. Last year, they published \"I Am A Filipino\" named one of 2018's best cookbooks by the New York Times and other publications.\n\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) cast-iron skillet or baking dish with butter or cooking spray and line it with the banana leaf. Trim the edges of the leaf so that it hangs over the skillet or dish by only an inch or two, then coat the leaf with more butter or spray.\n\n* In a large bowl, stir together the rice flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n\n* In a medium bowl, beat together the coconut milk, whole milk, melted butter, and raw eggs until well combined.\n\n* Slowly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, making sure they are well incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared skillet or baking dish and top it with the salted egg slices.\n\n1 cup (130 g) cornstarch\n\n1 cup (130 g) cake flour\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed\n\n1 cup (240 ml) shrimp stock (see Note) or water\n\n1 Japanese sweet potato, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\n2 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\n4 scallions, sliced lengthwise and then into 2-inch (3 cm) pieces\n\n1 medium white onion, peeled and cut into matchsticks Freshly ground black pepper\n\n\u00b9/\u00b3 cup (80 ml) vegetable oil, plus more as needed\n\n1 pound (455 g) raw small shrimp, peeled and deveined (see Note)\n\nMaldon sea salt, for sprinkling\n\nPinakurat (page 34), for serving\n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, cake flour, and kosher salt.\n\nStir in the stock and mix well.\n\n* In another large bowl, use your hands to mix together the sweet potato, carrot, scallion, and onion. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Add the vegetables to the batter, mixing so that the veggies are just coated. The batter should be thick but loose enough to coat the vegetables. If it is too thick, add a little water.\n\n* In a large saut\u00e9 pan, wok, or cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until it begins to shimmer, or registers 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set it nearby.\n\n* Using two large slotted spoons, make the ukoy by mounding some of the batter-coated vegetables onto the bowl of one spoon. Use your fingers to tuck a few shrimp into the middle of the nest, then top it off with more vegetables. Invert the other spoon over the pile, and gently shake off any excess batter into the bowl.\n\n* Working carefully, slide the ukoy off the spoons into the oil-it will be a little messy, but that's okay. Cook a few ukoy at a time, being careful not to crowd the pan, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the bottoms begin to crisp and turn golden brown. Flip and cook the ukoy for 3 to 5 minutes more, until crispy and golden brown on the second side.\n\n* Remove the fritters to the paper towels, sprinkle the tops with sea salt, and serve hot or at room temperature, with a small bowl of pinakurat for dipping.\n\nNote: Flavor the batter with shrimp stock of some kind, even just a stock made by soaking dried baby shrimp in hot water. You can also make a quick shrimp stock by simmering the peels and heads from the shrimp in 1\u00bd cups (360 ml) water for about 15 minutes.\n\n1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil\n\n1 cup (135 g) garlic cloves, sliced paper thin\n\n4 cups (800 g) freshly cooked jasmine rice, kept hot\n\nKosher salt\n\n2 to 4 large eggs, fried or sunny-side up (for serving)\n\n* In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby.\n\n* Carefully pour the garlic into the hot oil and stir continuously until the garlic is just beginning to lightly brown. Remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried garlic onto the paper towel-lined plate; reserve the oil. Set both the garlic and the oil aside while you make the rice. (You can store the garlic chips and oil in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to a week.)\n\n* Fluff the hot rice with a fork and toss it with \u00bc cup (60 ml) of the garlic oil and \u00bd cup (40 g) of the fried garlic chips. (You will have leftover oil and chips for more rice; or try them on the pansits and soups on pages 167-169.)\n\n* Season the rice with salt and serve right away or at room temperature, with the eggs, if desired.\n\nNotes: You can also make sinangag using rice left over from your meal from the previous day. Just heat the rice in a pan with a tablespoon or two of garlic oil. When the rice is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the garlic and a drizzle of garlic oil.\n\nAdd eggs and the sweet Filipino cured meat called tocino or the garlicky sausages called Lucban longanisa for a silog; it's an excellent breakfast. Include the Classic Ensalada (page 122) or cucumber relish (see page 123), too.\n\n1 (14-ounce/415 ml) can condensed milk\n\n1\u00bd cups (360 ml) coconut milk\n\n5 large eggs\n\n1 cup (200 g) sugar\n\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\n* In a medium bowl, beat together the condensed milk, coconut milk, and eggs until well incorporated. Set aside.\n\n* In a medium saucepan, melt the sugar over medium heat, stirring continuously with a spatula or wooden spoon until it begins to bubble and turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour the caramelized sugar over the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) deep-dish pie pan or baking dish, making sure it coats the entire pan.\n\n* Pour the milk-egg mixture over the caramelized sugar. Set the pie pan into a large baking dish and fill the baking dish with water to come halfway up the sides of the pie pan, being careful not to get water in the pan. Carefully transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until the center of the flan is set and no longer liquid.\n\n* Remove the pan from the water bath and let the flan cool slightly, then refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight before serving. (The flan will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)\n\n* To serve, gently invert the flan onto a serving plate and cut it into wedges. Serve cold or at room temperature.\n\n5 pounds (2.3 kg) oxtails, cut into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces\n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n7 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed\n\n2 red onions, cut into large dice\n\n2 celery stalks, cut into large dice\n\n1 carrot, cut into large dice\n\n\u00bd bunch fresh thyme\n\n4 cups (1 L) red wine (about 1\u00bc bottles), like a Cabernet Sauvignon\n\n1 cup (240 ml) Chinese Shaoxing cooking wine or sherry\n\n4 to 6 cups (1 to 1.4 L) stock, preferably beef\n\n1 pound (455 g) Chinese long beans or green beans\n\n1 garlic clove, minced\n\n1 pound Japanese eggplant, thickly sliced\n\n1 pound baby bok choy\n\n2 cups (480 ml) natural creamy peanut butter\n\n\u00bc cup (60 ml) soy sauce\n\nSugar\n\n\u00bd cup (120 ml) Achuete Oil\n\n4 to 6 cups (800 g to 1.2 kg) cooked white rice\n\nBagoong\n\n* The goal of the long cooking here is to make the meat very tender, though it looks best when you serve the oxtails whole-meaning don't cook them so long that the meat totally falls off the bone. If you can't find Chinese long beans-they're exactly what they sound like: long green beans grown in Asia-use green or yellow snap beans.\n\n* Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00baC). Season the oxtails well with salt and pepper.\n\n* In a Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed oven-safe pot, heat 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil over medium to medium-high heat. Brown the oxtails on all sides, then transfer them to a plate. (You may need to do this in batches to avoid crowding the pan.)\n\n* Remove all but a tablespoon or so of the fat from the pot and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, celery, and carrot and cook until they are soft and aromatic, 3 to 6 minutes.\n\n* Stir in the thyme, letting it just soften, then add the red wine and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n\n* Return the oxtails to the pot and add the Shaoxing wine and enough stock to cover the meat. Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and cook for 2\u00bd to 3 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender but not falling off the bone (see Notes).\n\n* While the oxtails cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and fill a large bowl with ice and water. When the water boils, add the long beans and cook for 1 minute, or just until they turn bright green. Immediately plunge them into the ice water and stir until all the beans feel cold to the touch. Drain and set aside.\n\n* In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, just until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is soft, about 10 minutes, then transfer the eggplant and garlic to a bowl and set aside. Wipe the skillet clean and heat 2 tablespoons more oil over medium heat. Add the bok choy and a pinch of salt and cook until bright green and tender yet firm, then set it aside on a separate plate.\n\n* When the oxtails are tender, remove the meat from the liquid in the pot and set it aside on a plate. Strain the braising liquid and discard the solids, then return the liquid to the pot and simmer over medium-high heat until it has reduced by half.\n\n* Reduce the heat to low, add the peanut butter and soy sauce, and stir until the peanut butter is incorporated and the sauce begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and add sugar, if desired, then stir in the achuete oil.\n\n* Return the meat to the pot and cook until it is heated through, a minute or two. Serve hot, with the vegetables, rice, and bagoong on the side.",

    "body": "You need to start with dried beans if you want that special texture\n\nIn the tinned versus dried beans debate, I go for the former to save time, but only when they are going to get a long cook with other ingredients - in a soup or stew, for example. But when flavour and texture are called for, I always go for dried. The key to success is in how you treat them. Much like you and I, every variety of bean has different needs: some require a little extra love, such as a good overnight soak, whereas others demand little more than a rinse and a quick cook. Prepared correctly, the result is a pot of beautifully cooked beans flavoured with your chosen aromatics and seasonings, making a wholesome yet frugal addition to any meal - minus, of course, the tin.\n\nWhite bean mash with confit garlic a\u00efoli (pictured above)\n\nI use garlic-infused olive oil three times in this dish: first to flavour a basic bean mash, then to make a thick a\u00efoli to go on top and finally in a layer of cooked beans to add textural interest. Omit the anchovies, if you like, to make it vegan. Serves six as a meze or side dish, or as a dip for flatbread.\n\nSoak Overnight\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 1 hr 20 min\n\nServes 6 as a side\n\n350g dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight in lots of cold water and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n\n1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges\n\n10 garlic cloves (ie, from about 1 whole head), peeled\n\n3 sprigs thyme\n\n2 sprigs rosemary\n\n1 green chilli, halved lengthways\n\n200ml olive oil\n\n1 tbsp dijon mustard\n\n2 anchovy fillets, drained (optional)\n\n90ml lemon juice (ie, from about 4 lemons)\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n10g fresh dill, roughly chopped\n\n\u00bd tsp aleppo chilli flakes (or another variety)\n\nDrain the beans and put them in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Add the onion and enough cold water to cover by about 4cm, then bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Cover, turn the heat down to medium and cook for about 50 minutes, or until the beans are very soft and starting to break up, then drain in a colander.\n\nMeanwhile, put the garlic, thyme, rosemary, green chilli and olive oil in a small saucepan for which you have a lid. Cover, put on a medium-low heat and leave to cook gently for 25-30 minutes, or until the garlic has softened and is just starting to colour. Take off the heat, set aside for 10 minutes, still covered, then strain through a sieve set over a bowl, to catch the solids and reserve the oil. Pick out the herbs and chilli, and set aside. Put the garlic in the small bowl of a food processor with 100g cooked beans, the mustard, anchovies (if using), two tablespoons of lemon juice, 75ml garlic oil, a tablespoon of water, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Blitz to a smooth, mayo-like consistency.\n\nIn a small bowl, mix 150g cooked beans with a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice, three tablespoons of garlic oil, the dill, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.\n\nOnce the remaining beans are cool, tip them and the onions into a food processor, and add two and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, three tablespoons of garlic oil, a half-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Blitz for a minute, until you have a thick but smooth mash, then transfer to a shallow bowl and spread out over the base, making a slight well in the centre. Fill the well with the confit garlic a\u00efoli, smoothing it out, then top with the herby bean mixture. Sprinkle over the aleppo chilli, top with the reserved chilli, rosemary and thyme, and serve.\n\nRice and mung bean kubbeh\n\nKubbeh comes in many shapes and forms, one of them being this Iraqi rice version. Known as kubbeh halab, it's usually stuffed with spiced lamb or beef, but here I've used mung beans (which are technically legumes, not beans) to make a vegetarian alternative.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 2 hr 10 min\n\nServes 6 as a starter\n\n350g basmati rice\n\n\u00bc tsp ground turmeric\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n1 egg, beaten\n\n105ml olive oil\n\n80g green mung beans\n\n1\u00bd onions, peeled and finely chopped\n\n4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated\n\n1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped\n\n1 tsp ground cumin\n\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\n\u00be tsp ground allspice\n\n10g picked coriander leaves, roughly chopped\n\n2 lemons - 1 juiced, to get 1 tbsp, the other cut into 6 wedges\n\n500ml sunflower oil, for frying, plus extra for shaping\n\n150g Greek-style yoghurt, to serve\n\nPut the rice in a sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Leave to drain for five minutes, then transfer to a medium saucepan for which you have a lid. Add 750ml water, the turmeric and two teaspoons of salt, and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Turn the heat to low, cover and leave to cook for 15 minutes, then turn off the heat and let it sit, still covered, for 15 minutes more.\n\nTip the cooked rice into a bowl and leave to cool for 30 minutes. Add the egg, three tablespoons of olive oil, 70ml water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and mix to combine. Use your hands to mash the rice into a sticky dough - enough so that the grains are no longer discernible - then cover and set aside.\n\nMeanwhile, cook the mung beans in boiling water for about 25 minutes, or until softened and slightly overcooked. Drain through a sieve, then run under cold water to cool. Transfer to a bowl and use your hands or the back of a fork to mash the beans very roughly, making sure you keep some of them intact.\n\nPut three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and well browned - about 12 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and chilli, fry for a minute, then add the spices and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Tip into the mung bean bowl, and mix in the coriander, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of lemon juice, the remaining tablespoon of oil and a good grind of black pepper.\n\nKeeping a small bowl of sunflower oil beside you, oil your hands and roll the rice mixture into 20 balls each weighing 55-60g. Take one ball in one hand, then use your free index finger to push a deep cavity in the centre of the ball, swivelling as you go, to create a cavity about 4cm wide; take care you don't pierce it all the way through. Spoon a tablespoon of the bean mixture into the cavity (about 15-20g worth), then use your hands to seal and shape the kubbeh into the traditional \"torpedo\" shape. Smooth out any cracks on the outside, making sure the kubbeh is well sealed, then repeat with the remaining rice balls and bean filling, re-oiling your hands as required.\n\nPut the sunflower oil in a medium, high-sided saute pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, fry the kubbeh in batches for about eight to 10 minutes in total, turning them halfway, or until crisp and lightly golden. Transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper and repeat with the remaining kubbeh. Serve warm or at room temperature with the lemon wedges and yoghurt alongside.\n\nBraised beef short ribs with butterbeans and figs\n\nDon't be intimidated by the cooking time here; once the pot goes in the oven, it's mostly a waiting game, so you can prep everything in the afternoon and have it ready in time for a decadent dinner - just make sure you get ahead by soaking the beans first.\n\nSoak Overnight\n\nPrep 25 min\n\nCook 4 hr 10 min\n\nServes 4\n\n2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped\n\n4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped\n\n2 green chillies, roughly chopped, seeds and all\n\n6 beef short ribs (ie, about 1.5kg)\n\nSalt and black pepper\n\n60ml olive oil\n\n4 whole star anise\n\n10 cardamom pods, roughly bashed open in a mortar\n\n1\u00bd tbsp tomato paste\n\n2 tsp ground allspice\n\n2 tsp ground cumin\n\n5-6 large plum tomatoes, two thirds roughly chopped, the rest roughly grated and skins discarded\n\n100g soft dried figs, roughly chopped into 1\u00bdcm pieces\n\n250g dried butter beans, soaked overnight in plenty of water and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n\n30g chives, very finely chopped\n\n1\u00bd tbsp lemon juice\n\n300g large leaf spinach, stems discarded and leaves roughly torn\n\nHeat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/365F/gas 4\u00bd. In a food processor, pulse the onions, garlic, ginger and chillies a few times, until very finely chopped.\n\nPat dry the short ribs and lightly sprinkle them all over with salt and pepper. Put two tablespoons of oil in a large, cast-iron, ovenproof saucepan for which you have a lid, and heat on a medium-high flame. In batches of two, fry the short ribs until golden on all sides - about four minutes a batch - then transfer to a tray while you repeat with the rest.\n\nTip the onion mixture into the same pan, add the star anise and cardamom, and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, or until softened. Add the tomato paste, ground spices, chopped tomatoes (reserve the grated ones), a teaspoon and a half of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for four minutes, until the tomatoes start to break down. Return the short ribs to the pan, add 1.1 litres cold water and bring to a boil. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for three hours, stirring every now and then. Add the figs, and cook for 30 minutes more, until they have softened and the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone.\n\nWhile the ribs are cooking, drain the beans and put them in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid. Pour over enough water to cover by about 4cm and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook the beans for 60-70 minutes, or until they are soft but still retain their shape; add a teaspoon of salt for the last 15 minutes of cooking. When done, cover with a lid and set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, mix the chives with the remaining two tablespoons of oil, lemon juice, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a grind of pepper.\n\nLift the short ribs from the pan, and gently tug at the bones to pull them away from the meat (discard the bones). Put the pan on a medium-high heat and, once the contents are bubbling, add the spinach and stir until it has wilted - about three minutes. Add the grated tomato and remove from the heat.\n\nTo serve, drain the beans and discard their cooking liquid, then stir into the chive oil. Divide the sauce between four plates, and top first with the bean mixture and then the meat, reserving any extra ribs for seconds.",

    "body": "By Tim Reynolds\u2009|\u2009AP March 8 at 11:26 PM\n\nMIAMI -- Rodney McGruder was having a quiet night.\n\nAnd in a span of 22 seconds, everything changed.\n\nJosh Richardson scored 20 points to lead a club record-tying eight Miami players in double figures, McGruder had a seven-point possession in the fourth quarter to help put the game away, and the Heat beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 126-110 on Friday night.\n\n\"How can you not have fun right now, in a playoff hunt, in a playoff race?\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"To be in a playoff race, every game has context and pressure and meaning to it, that's a lot of fun. I want our guys to have fun with this.\"\n\nFun was had. Miami beat Cleveland at home for the 16th consecutive time, a Heat record against any opponent. Bam Adebayo scored 17 points and Justise Winslow finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and nine assists for the Heat -- who got 15 points from Kelly Olynyk, 13 from McGruder, 12 from Dwyane Wade, and 11 apiece from Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside.\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun. It has been,\" McGruder said. \"You can see it on everyone's faces out there on the court. We're just enjoying everyone's success.\"\n\nHis seven-point, 22-second play sealed the outcome.\n\nHe made a 3-pointer from the left corner while getting flagrantly fouled by Kevin Love. McGruder made the ensuing free throw, Miami retained the ball because of the flagrant, and McGruder then made a 3 from the right corner. A nine-point game became a 16-point game in an instant, and Miami soon finished off its fourth straight win to remain No. 8 in the East.\n\n\"Strength in numbers,\" Wade said. \"At this time of the year, the numbers really don't matter. It's about us having team success.\"\n\nCollin Sexton led Cleveland with 27 points. Jordan Clarkson scored 21, Love had 19 and Brandon Knight finished with 15 for the Cavaliers, who were officially eliminated from playoff contention.\n\n\"They got in their run at the right time,\" Clarkson said. \"But I felt we were in the game for the most part. Just a lot of mistakes in the fourth.\"\n\nThe Cavs made 19 3s, three of them coming from Sexton, who broke Kyrie Irving's club rookie for 3s by a rookie. But the Cavs lost Larry Nance Jr. to a chest injury in the third quarter, and he did not return. He was scoreless in 17 minutes.\n\nCavs coach Larry Drew said his team won't play out the season like nothing matters.\n\n\"That's not an option and our guys understand that,\" Drew said. \"Every time we step out on the floor, we're going to have some good days and bad days, we understand that. But we will continue to look like a basketball team.\"\n\nIt was Miami's third game in five days -- and like the first two, it was tied at halftime.\n\nNeither team ever led by more than five points in the opening 24 minutes, which featured 22 lead changes and 13 ties. Cleveland outscored Miami 29-28 in the first quarter, the Heat outscored the Cavaliers 29-28 in the second, and that adds up to a 57-57 knotting at intermission.\n\nBut in the third, the Heat got separation. Miami shot 68 percent in the quarter and went into the fourth up 94-83.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCavaliers: Love said he hasn't decided if he will be part of USA Basketball's quest to win the Basketball World Cup in China this summer. He'll give it more serious thought after the season. \"USA Basketball has been very good to me in my career,\" Love said. ... Matthew Dellavedova (concussion protocol) missed the game. He took a hard hit late in the game at Brooklyn on Wednesday.\n\nHeat: A video tribute to former Heat forward Chris \"Birdman\" Andersen played in the third quarter. Andersen was at the game. ... Olynyk has made at least one 3-pointer in 11 consecutive games, a new career high.... Friday marked the first game this season where the Heat had no players ruled out with injuries.\n\nSTAYING HOME\n\nThe game kicked off a season-high, five-game homestand for Miami, which has matchups left with Toronto, Detroit, Milwaukee and Charlotte -- all either playoff-bound or playoff-contending in the East -- before hitting the road again. Once this homestand ends, Miami will have only four home games left before the end of the regular season.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nKnight, who grew up in nearby Fort Lauderdale, played at Miami for the ninth time in his NBA career. Each of his last four appearances have come with him wearing four different uniforms -- Milwaukee, then Phoenix, then Houston and now Cleveland. He's also played at Miami with Detroit.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCavaliers: Host Toronto on Monday.\n\nHeat: Host Toronto on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

The victory also was the Heat's 16th straight against the Cavaliers at AmericanAirlines Arena.\n\nRodney McGruder scored 11 points in the fourth and 13 overall as Wade added six more in the final quarter as Miami opened up a 19-point lead with just over four minutes remaining.\n\nEight Heat players scored in double figures.

It's the heat sink, and it's made from a material that conducts heat well -- usually aluminum, sometimes copper. A heat sink helps cool the processor by absorbing the semiconductor's heat and dissipating into the air. They're nearly always finned, which increases the surface area, making the heat sink more effective.\n\nPhysicist Lee Huang has turned this idea on its head and applied it to cookware. Rather than dissipating heat, the finned base of Huang's \"Turbo Pot\" draws more heat from a gas flame than a traditional flat-bottomed pot.\n\nHere's Tekla Perry, writing for IEEE Spectrum:\n\nRelatedA Twin Towers' Survivor StorySaving Venice From the SeaStable Isotopes in Forensics\n\nHuang's business has grown slowly, but he is optimistic. Besides Carraba's, he's sold pots to Panda Express and Cheesecake Factory. He says Carraba's and Panda Express are using his pots to save money, turning down the burners but not changing their cooking time. Carraba's reported that the company was able to turn the burner's down to 15,000 BTU/hour (4.4 kilowatts) from 30,000 or 33,000 BTU (8.8-9.7 kw), saving enough money to payback the cost of the new pots in five to six months. Cheesecake Factory, however, sees the Turbo Pots as a way to speed up productivity and cook faster.\n\nHuang has been talking to energy companies about efficiency rebates for the pots. Even without a rebate, consumers may have another incentive to buy his wares -- according to the Turbo Pot website , finned pots boil 1.5 liters of water in half the time.",

    "title": "Anatomy of a Super Typhoon",
    "body": "Why was Haiyan so destructive? Changing climate and ocean current patterns turned what might have been an \"ordinary\" storm into one of the most devastating in the Philippines's history.\n\nReceive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.\n\nEmail AddressZip CodeSubscribe\n\nBy any measure, Super Typhoon Haiyan was one of the most extraordinary tropical cyclones in world history. Tropical cyclones rarely reach Category 5 strength, when wind speeds exceed 155 mph. In fact, an average of just four Category 5 storms occur globally each year. But as Haiyan hurtled westwards towards the Philippines across the warm waters of the West Pacific Ocean during the first week of November 2013, the storm fed off the deepest region of warm waters anywhere on the planet, rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm.\n\nAs it swept over the open ocean, it continued to draw strength from the unusually warm waters below. Three hours before landfall, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said Haiyan's winds were blowing at a sustained 195 mph and gusting to 235 mph, making it the fourth strongest tropical cyclone in world history.\n\nSatellite data suggests that Haiyan weakened only slightly, if at all, in the two hours after that advisory. The super typhoon likely made landfall with winds near 195 mph. The next JTWC intensity estimate, made about three hours after landfall, showed the winds had only slowed to 185 mph. If we take the average of these readings, we can estimate that Haiyan's winds were a devastating 190 mph just one hour after landfall.\n\nWith winds of 190-195 mph at landfall, Haiyan is the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world history, a record previously held by the Hurricane Camille of 1969, which made landfall in Mississippi with 190 mph winds. (The margin may be even greater because meteorologists\n\nRelatedA Primer of GemstonesThe Fate of Easter IslandGalileo's Big Mistake now recognize that the maximum sustained winds estimated for typhoons were overestimated during the 1940s to 1960s.) It is also the deadliest and most costly tropical typhoon in the history of the Philippines. Haiyan has killed over 6,000 people and caused $13 billion worth of damage, or about 5% of the Philippines's GDP.\n\nWith Haiyan, the Philippines has experienced their three most expensive natural disasters in history in a 12-month time span: Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 ($13 billion), Super Typhoon Bopha in December 2012 ($1.7 billion), and the torrential rains in and around the capital city of Manila in August 2013 ($1.7 billion). Among them, Haiyan stood out not only for its devastation, but also for the way it gathered strength over the ocean. So what made the storm so powerful? And can we expect more like it in the near future?\n\nA Long Climate Shift\n\nHaiyan may have been decades in the making. Since the early 1990s, sub-surface waters east of the Philippines have warmed remarkably due to a shift in atmospheric circulation patterns and ocean currents. Hurricanes are heat engines, which means they take heat energy out of the ocean, and convert it to kinetic energy in the form of wind.\n\nTropical cyclones need surface water temperatures of at least 26.5 \u02daC to maintain themselves. The warmer the water, and the deeper the warm water is, the stronger the storm can get. Deep warm water is key. As a tropical cyclone moves over the ocean, it stirs up cooler water from the depths, which can reduce the intensity of the storm.\n\nBoth Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita crossed over an eddy in the Gulf of Mexico with a lot of deep warm water. Both storms, too, grew into Category 5 hurricanes. Even before the conditions that produced Haiyan, the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines has the largest area of deep warm water of anywhere on Earth, and these waters have historically fueled the highest incidence of Category 5 storms of anywhere on the planet.\n\nBut while Super Typhoon Haiyan tracked over surface waters that were close to average warmth, 29.5-30.5 \u02daC, the waters at a depth of 100 meters were a huge 3 \u02daC above average, according to Professor I-I Lin of the Department of Atmospheric Science at the National Taiwan University, who studied data from Argo floats which collect temperature and salinity information on the world's oceans. As the typhoon stirred this unusually warm water to the surface, the storm was likely able to feed off the heat, allowing Haiyan to intensify into one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever observed.\n\nWarm Down Deep\n\nThe average temperature of those sub-surface waters east of the Philippines has risen dramatically over the past twenty years. Warm, 26 \u02daC water now penetrates 17% deeper than in the early 1990s, and the tropical cyclone heat potential has increased by 13% . The warm-up is due to an increase in the surface winds blowing across the region -- the trade winds -- which have caused a southward migration and strengthening of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC).\n\nOver the past 20 years, strong trade winds have piled a large amount of water up against the east coast of the Philippines, resulting in a rate of sea level rise of 10 mm per year -- more than triple the global average of 3.1 mm per year. Sea level rise data from Legaspi in the Eastern Philippines shows a rise of about 305 mm, or 12 inches, since 1949. For comparison, global average sea level rose 190 mm, or about 7.5 inches, since 1901. This extra sea level rise added to the storm surge damage from Super Typhoon Haiyan. Part of the rise along the eastern Philippine coast is from tectonic processes -- the Philippine plate is subsiding under the Eurasian plate -- but most of it is due to the stronger trade winds and the fact that warmer waters expand, raising sea level.\n\nQuickening Trade Winds\n\nThe swifter trade winds are the result of a series of complex processes. The surface trade winds in the equatorial Pacific are part of the Walker Circulation -- a pattern of rising and sinking air along the Equator influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a cycle. A strong Walker circulation lowers pressure over Indonesia, which pulls in more air at the surface along the Equator from the east, increasing the easterly trade winds. As these trade winds strengthen, their friction against the surface of the ocean pulls water away from South America, which allows cold water to well up to the surface. This is a La Ni\u00f1a-like situation, which takes heat energy out of the atmosphere and puts it into the ocean. This keeps global surface temperatures cooler than they would otherwise be. The opposite is a weakened Walker circulation, which produces weaker trade winds and a more El Ni\u00f1o-like situation with higher global surface temperatures.\n\nA strong Walker circulation has existed since the early 1990s. As long as that holds, global surface temperatures should stay cooler, prolonging the slow-down in global surface warming that has received much attention recently. But even that may be the result of gaps in weather station data. A paper released late last year fills in gaps left by the lack of weather stations in the Arctic. When the researchers filled those holes using satellite data, they discovered the global surface warming trend is more than twice that predicted by a commonly used data set.\n\nWith global temperatures on the rise, Haiyan may be a harbinger of things to come for the Philippines. Meteorologists and climatologists suspect the dual trends of warmer sub-surface water temperatures and shifting ocean currents will likely subject the island nation to more super typhoons and higher storm surges.\n\nClimate models have been predicting that the Walker circulation should weaken, creating a more El Ni\u00f1o like situation. But that's the opposite of what's been happening over the past 20 years. Though if you remove removed how the atmosphere responds to the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a cycle, as another recent paper did , the resulting pattern they found showed a steady strengthening of the Walker circulation in concert with global rising temperatures.\n\nThe question this raises is, are we seeing a failure of the climate models? Or is the recent speed-up of the Walker circulation a decades-long, but ultimately fleeting, shift in the climate system? Time will tell.",

I'm snorkeling with coral ecologist Hannah Barkley in blue-green Nikko Bay, where limestone mushrooms jut from the water to form the kind of terrain you'd expect around a Bond villain's lair. Here in the Rock Islands of Palau, natural conditions offer a glimpse into the Pacific Ocean expected by the end of this century -- when it's acidified by dissolved carbon dioxide from an overladen atmosphere. By all rights we should see a dire, climate-changed wasteland.\n\nBut the corals here look fine.\n\nSupport Provided ByLearn More\n\nBetter than fine. It's gorgeous, an explosion in a paint factory. Tropical fish flit between tumorous yellow mounds, rusty ginger roots, and red-orange pancake stacks topped with stalactites. Some aged coral clumps are tipped to the side like fallen trees, their bone-white bases exposed, but new shoots are springing up perpendicularly toward the sun. When we surface, Barkley is grinning ear to ear.\n\nIt's Barkley's sixth time in Palau, and the seventh trip to the Micronesian country for Anne Cohen's lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, where Barkley is a Ph.D. student. What began as a fact-finding mission in preparation for climate change has blossomed into something bigger, more prognostic, and more hopeful.\n\nThe bad news first: over the next century of climate change, all coral reefs will have to contend with two inextricable, inexorable pressures. One is global warming, where hotter ocean temperatures will lead to the wide-scale \"bleaching\" of reefs. The second is ocean acidification. About a third of the carbon dioxide we add to the atmosphere ends up mixing with the seas, souring the oceans for the many creatures that scaffold their squishy bodies with hard shells made from the mineral aragonite.\n\nBut to their surprise, Cohen's team has found that the corals in Nikko Bay and a few other naturally acidified Rock Island sites seem to be shrugging off this sneak preview of the coral-reef apocalypse. If these locales can be preserved, ecologists think they might have a better chance of surviving climate change than anywhere else in the Palauan archipelago.\n\nToday, Nikko Bay, with its warm, acidified water and healthy corals, sits precariously at the intersection of three worlds. Scientists are forging on with their studies, engrossed in the minutiae of what makes these corals special, conservationists are holding it up as a reason for optimism, and Palauans, tied to the sea, are trying to save these reefs while they still can.\n\nAnne Cohen describes the discovery in Palau.\n\nA single event binds them all together. In 1998, heat waves from a vicious El Ni\u00f1o event devastated reefs across the globe. The sudden loss of 16% of the world's coral cast a shadow into the future, toward what some experts are calling the \"end of reefs.\" But this cataclysm also inspired conservationists to look for pockets of climate-change resistance, and it pressed Palau to invest in the very research infrastructure that would make Cohen's later work possible.\n\nAnd in its wake, the El Ni\u00f1o brought the first hints that the bays between Palau's Rock Island might be worth a close look.\n\nBorn in a Crisis\n\nYimnang Golbuu, Cohen's main Palauan collaborator, grew up in a neighborhood with one black-and-white TV. He spent his childhood outside -- fishing, swimming, hunting small geckos in the forest -- before crossing the Pacific to major in biology at the University of California, Davis.\n\nCompared with Palau, Golbuu tells me, the winters in California were intolerable. After surviving the cold temperatures, the ecological train wreck of Guam, where he subsequently went for his master's degree, was distressing. One thought kept him going: \"I'm going to come back to Palau,\" Golbuu says.\n\nBut shortly after he returned, the reefs he loved went to hell. The El Ni\u00f1o of '98, like Ni\u00f1os in other years, saw a break in the winds that push water across the Pacific. Stagnant currents changed weather patterns on a global scale, subjecting tropical reefs worldwide to weeks and weeks of warmer-than-usual water.\n\nIn 50 countries, the photosynthetic algae that live inside corals and help feed them short-circuited in the heat, releasing destructive free radicals. Perturbed by the conduct of their tenants, the host corals expelled their algae to limit the damage.\n\nNormally, the turquoise shoals between Palau's Rock Islands show dark patches of coral against the sandy bottom. When the bleaching hit, these shadows turned white. The corals no longer had their algae; the colorful pigments inside were gone. As a result, giant swaths of these bleached corals starved and died.\n\nOn land, Palau was stricken by drought. The trees that jostle to fill every nook and cranny of the Rock Islands wilted, repainting Palau's most scenic, unique landscape in rustlike tones. Groundwater in the populous, porous karst island of Koror dried up, forcing residents to get their water from the volcanic island Babeldaob.\n\nIn the face of this climate-related hardship, the need for reef conservation and research in a nation so dependent on marine resources could no longer be ignored. Three years after the crisis, the Palau International Coral Reef Center, also known as PICRC, was born. Palau had beat out several other Pacific countries for funding from Japan.\n\nOnce this research apparatus was in place, another consequence of the disastrous bleaching came into focus. Surveyors noticed a strange pattern when they started monitoring the nation's reefs. \"We could see that some of the sites just are doing better than others,\" Golbuu says, over his desk. In 2012, Golbuu became perhaps the first Palauan to get a science Ph.D. It was covered in the newspaper, turning him into a local celebrity. We're speaking in Golbuu's air-conditioned office on the second floor of PICRC, where he is both CEO and head researcher.\n\nNot all the coral had been hammered. There were still spots that looked more or less intact. \"That kind of gave us a clue that things are different in these different sites,\" he says.\n\nBut because monitoring hadn't yet begun at the onset of the El Ni\u00f1o event in 1998, there wasn't a clear explanation for the healthy patches. Were some corals just bouncing back faster? Had the temperature not risen as high in those sites, causing less bleaching? Or had the corals themselves stubbornly resisted the heat?\n\nA smaller bleaching in 2010 helped settle the question in favor of that last -- and perhaps most intriguing -- possibility. PICRC researchers went out and surveyed 80 coral communities across the archipelago. As before, some sites had bleached more than others. But how a spot fared didn't seem to be explainable by records of temperature.\n\nSome reefs that didn't bleach had been even hotter than reefs that did, showing that mild weather wasn't saving these corals. Golbuu suspects that the harsh environment had made the corals tougher. \"And now these are the same sites that Anne [Cohen] is finding,\" he says. \"These are very acidic sites.\"\n\nCohen herself first came to Palau in April 2011, backed by the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. In yet another thread tracing back to the '98 bleaching, Cohen was offered several Pacific locations to visit; she chose Palau because of the research infrastructure that had sprung up in response to the crisis.\n\nCohen had heard that the enclosed bays had proved resistant to bleaching. And as a specialist in ocean acidification, she had a hunch that these same locales might also be responding to unusual chemistry.\n\nPalau's Rock Islands, the 20-million-year-old backbones of ancient coral reefs, provide a pinball machine's worth of obstacles for ocean water that trickles through toward the innermost bays. In Nikko Bay, where corals had weathered the '98 bleaching, water is trapped for months on end.\n\nIn these conditions, Cohen knew that the corals themselves could change the water chemistry. To build a skeleton, corals pull calcium and carbonate ions from the water and knit them into sturdy crystals of aragonite. This process is known as calcification. Just as breathing exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide, slowly spoiling the air in a closed space, calcification draws carbonate out of the water, making the process progressively harder. And the corals are literally breathing, too, which adds more carbon dioxide, which in turn acidifies the water even more. Carbonate gets even harder to come by.\n\nOcean acidification makes it increasingly difficult for corals to build their skeletons.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Cohen sent a postdoctoral researcher, Katie Shamberger, and her grad student Barkley to test the water in those enclosed bays. It was true exploration, Barkley recalls. \"We basically looked at a map and said, 'OK.' Where can we go that looks like it might be interesting?\" Even after they took the water samples, months passed before they knew how extreme conditions in the bays really were. The eureka moment happened not in Palau, but back at WHOI, after the samples were analyzed.\n\nBarkley can still picture a beaming Cohen walking into the lab to announce that Nikko Bay was significantly more acidic than the tipping point expected to mark the end of reefs. \"I was like 'No way!' \" Barkley says. Having first seen Nikko Bay's vibrant corals in person, it was hard to believe. \"It was wow ,\" Cohen recalls. \"These reefs are at 2100 A.D. These reefs are in the future.\"\n\nSeeking Refugia\n\nAs Palau was responding proactively to the '98 bleaching crisis, the Nature Conservancy embarked on a hunt for refugia, or reefs that might be least vulnerable to climate change. And in a coincidence almost too good to be true, the idea that led to this new strategy came in the Rock Islands of Palau.\n\nRod Salm, Cohen's backer at the Nature Conservancy, is the well-spoken, well-traveled director of marine conservation for the Asia Pacific region. His resume is a naturalist's fantasy: Mauritius, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and the Seychelles with the World Wildlife Fund in the 1970s; a doctorate studying the Chagos Archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean; then a stint in the new world, followed by four years in Indonesia and eight years in Oman.\n\nThen, in 1999, when Salm was stationed in Nairobi, an otherwise ordinary moment turned into a revelation. He was helping his daughter with a high school research project. Together, they drove to the Kenyan coast and chose a long, thin island running north to south. The east side faced the ocean, catching the morning sun; the west side was sheltered, with mangroves nearby and motes of sediment twinkling in the light each afternoon. This being just after the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o, Salm helped his daughter look for bleaching. Corals on the east side? White as bone. On the west side? Normal.\n\nIt was puzzling. Later that year, Salm began travelling to coral reefs across the Pacific for his new job with the Nature Conservancy to survey the El Ni\u00f1o's aftermath elsewhere: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands. \"I began suddenly to see patterns,\" Salm says, \"particularly in Palau.\"\n\nHis epiphany happened at Palau's Cemetery Reef, where the corner of one of the Rock Islands arcs down to meet the water's surface. Underneath, the slope continues, with green vegetation replaced by foliose corals the color of yellow ochre, stretching like giant sheets of lichen. At least, that's how it looked in January 2015. When Salm first visited after the bleaching, all the corals were dead.\n\nAt the time, Salm had swum toward the island, over whitewashed corals and rubble, until he was halfway under the circumferential groove cut into each of the Rock Islands by grazing mollusks. Once his pupils adjusted to the shade, \"Suddenly I noticed that the corals under my fins were dead and the ones under my mask were alive,\" he says. \"That's when it hit me.\"\n\nThe shade was saving the corals. It was embarrassingly obvious. It explained what he had seen in Kenya with his daughter: the sunnier side of the island had bleached, while the shaded side, with murkier water, had not. Heat plus bright light could cause the photosynthetic algae to release free radicals, causing corals to bleach. During heat waves, shadier places might stand a better chance. So might places where heat waves were buffered by deeper, colder water, an idea first suggested by researcher Peter Glynn in 1996 .\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o of '98 had been a wakeup call to the threat posed by climate change, yet it left managers of marine protected areas with a sense of helplessness. Protecting reefs from humans was one thing: They could limit fishing, restrict where boats could anchor, oppose coastal development. Global warming was different, almost unstoppable. Neither coral scientists nor reef managers knew how deal with it.\n\nBut here was hope. While many coral-reef scientists were studying the death and destruction of '98 like photographers documenting war atrocities, Salm's reaction was to pour resources into finding and studying the corals that hadn't bleached. Managers would have the best chance to save these reefs.\n\nSalm first presented his idea in 2000 at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Bali. It struck a chord. Billy Causey, now a director of marine sanctuaries at NOAA, then superintendent of the Florida Keys sanctuary, commented that natural refugia could explain the bleaching pattern he had seen in the Keys. Afterward, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy put down money for further research. A new paradigm had been born, balancing optimism with pragmatism. But there was little time to celebrate.\n\nBy 2005 and 2006, scientists had grown increasingly concerned about the impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide on ocean chemistry. Researchers, having seen corals struggle in aquarium tanks at low pH, could extrapolate out to a tipping point when the world's reefs would dissolve faster than they could calcify. Algae would fill in the gaps. The world was on a \"slippery slope to slime,\" wrote coral ecologist John Pandolfi.\n\nCoral bleaching had been a shock when it first struck, a problem nothing in the conservationist toolbox could address. Strategies had to be developed after the fact. Yet this time, with ocean acidification, they had advance warning. The plan was to \"have a jump on it when it hit,\" Salm says.\n\nAnne Cohen explains why ocean acidification can only be solved through international cooperation.\n\nIn 2008, Salm convened a meeting of scientists and conservationists in Honolulu. Together, they crafted a strategic response to ocean acidification, which one attendee aptly described as osteoporosis of the reef. Among their recommendations: to search for biodiverse reefs that might be less vulnerable to ocean acidification.\n\nThanks to Salm's work, one method for hunting down climate-change refugia -- seeking out places resistant to heat waves -- already existed. But it applied to bleaching, and acidification has a different profile. Bleaching happens in pulses, when waves of hot water wash over the reef. Ocean acidification is most often a steady pressure. They obey different oceanographic rules, too. Take the Galapagos, for example. There, the upwelling of cold water helps corals resist bleaching, but cold water also holds more carbon dioxide, making it more acidic. In other words, a refuge for one might not protect against the other.\n\nSalm met Cohen, an expert in carbonate chemistry and ocean acidification. He pushed her toward Palau, where Golbuu offered plenty of support, and where a wide range of habitats were thrown together in close proximity. And there they found far more than they'd bargained for.\n\nPicking Winners\n\nAfter Barkley and I get out of the water in Nikko, we head to another acidified yet healthy coral community in Palau, this one in Risong Bay just to the southwest. We're pelted by angry pellets of rain, the boat bouncing jarringly over the waves.\n\nAs the boat slows to traverse a narrow channel, the trees above are nearly touching, their shadows reflected on the water's surface with yellow boulder corals below. The boat emerges into a clearing, the Rock Islands curving around us. This is Chiropsalmus basin, named for a box jellyfish. Cohen's team calls it the Jacuzzi.\n\nUsing a GPS device tied onto a buoy, Barkley and technical diver Pat Lohmann put on SCUBA gear and map the outlines of the coral growing underneath us. I snorkel above, thinking about refugia, wondering whether I'm swimming in one.\n\nWhen I ask Barkley whether Nikko Bay and Risong's Jacuzzi are truly refugia, she refers me to the Nature Conservancy's Elizabeth Mcleod, who works with Salm. Mcleod, with a measure of caution that's common among ecologists, gently resists the poetic notion of refugia in favor of hard data. \"I would be uncomfortable if any scientist says that we know that this area is definitively a refuge,\" she says.\n\nPerhaps it helps to unpack the idea of a refuge, where creatures survive and then go forth to repopulate other areas. In Salm's writings on climate change, he breaks down the search for \"less vulnerable\" spots into a few dimensions. First is avoidance: a particular place that is entirely spared from adverse conditions. Considering that warming and acidification are both global in scale, it won't be easy to find reefs that can avoid them. Then there's resistance: the ability of corals to experience heat waves and not die, or to live in acidified waters and keep growing. Resistance could be innate, the province of hardened, tough corals, as Cohen suspects is the case in Palau's acidified bays. Or it could be environmental, like the shade Rod Salm saw in Kenya -- which may have also saved Nikko Bay's corals from bleaching. It's hard to untangle. And last is resilience, or a reef's ability to grow back quickly and to send its larvae far and wide.\n\nPresently, with the worst of climate change still to come, reef refugia seem distant and abstract. But the ideal of a refuge -- the one weapon reef managers have against climate change, save a reduction in carbon emissions -- is still on the horizon. Perhaps Palau's bays will pan out as climate change refugia, or perhaps what researchers learn in Palau will help them find refugia elsewhere. Knowing for sure will take time, which there isn't much of.\n\nThere's another way to put it, one that acknowledges a fundamental truth: conservation costs money, both to fund the research and to commit to saving a place. On the day I spoke to Salm, he mentioned spending an hour and a half on the phone with a donor. The donor, about to give a talk to students on the subject of winners and losers in business, intended to draw heavily on Salm's philosophy. His idea was that since climate change conservation -- and perhaps life -- are inherent gambles, it makes sense to bet on proven winners.\n\nBack at the Jacuzzi reef, we climb out of the water, then return to Nikko Bay so that Barkley can take water samples. As we leave, beside two islands in the middle of the bay, we see a boat tugging an inflatable banana straddled by four whooping Asian tourists.\n\n\"This is your refugia?\" I say to Barkley, raising my voice over the engine and the wind. She laughs and yells back at me: the tourists could be doing worse.\n\nThe Other Threats\n\nOn my last night in Palau, Barkley and I meet for dinner at Taj, Palau's surprisingly good Indian restaurant. \"The first time I jumped in Nikko Bay it was just breathtaking,\" she says. The reef was more colorful, rich, and diverse than any reef she'd ever dived on, and this was before the team knew how acidified it was. Learning that these corals were living in extreme conditions made it all the more amazing.\n\nBy now, thousands of water samples, numerous measurements, and myriad experiments over the seven trips to Palau have left the team confident about the response of corals to conditions in places like Nikko Bay. In the acidified spots, coral cover is high, diversity is high, and the reefs appear to be healthy. The problem lies in what to make of these facts.\n\n\"It's really easy to assume that oh, well, Palau's doing fine. Reefs don't care about ocean acidification,\" Barkley tells me. The team has been careful to avoid saying anything like it. They haven't even promised that they've found refugia. But Barkley still feels the work on Nikko Bay can be a source of hope. It means that somewhere, corals can survive these hostile conditions.\n\nOutside critics are in qualified agreement. Katharina Fabricius, a coral ecologist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, thinks that corals in locations like Nikko Bay are healthy only because the bays are so sheltered from storms. She also worries that despite Nikko Bay's diversity, the main reef-building corals are absent -- a claim Cohen's team hopes to parry in a new study to be released in the journal Science Advances in June. Whether or not the Palau results are an optimistic findings \"depends on how clear the caveats are expressed,\" Fabricius tells me.\n\nBarkley is working with Salm and Mcleod, who want a map of carbonate chemistry across the Palauan islands to compare with satellite data from elsewhere. \"We need to understand: what are those patterns?\" McLeod says. \"How do we identify those potential refugia across the archipelago without having to jump in the water and sample every coral?\" Barkley's map, once produced, will inform searches for refugia around the world.\n\nUsing satellite images, Barkley has already found another place with a landscape similar to the Rock Islands, this time in Indonesia. Perhaps the pitted limestone islands there harbor acidification-resistant corals, too. But we'll have to wait to find out -- a scouting trip planned for the spring of 2015 was scuttled when obtaining permits proved a challenge.\n\nIn the meantime, Barkley's goal is to hand Golbuu and Palauan officials a stack of maps that show pH and climate change tolerance across the island system. That would indicate which places she thinks have the best chance of surviving ocean acidification over the next century.\n\nBut as Golbuu told me in his office, the lobbying to protect the acidified Rock Island bays has already started, even before Barkley's comprehensive recommendation comes in. Nikko Bay is at particular risk because it is close to Palau's population centers, making it more vulnerable to the traditional threats to reefs: pollution, development, and sediment runoff.\n\nThese corals \"might survive the end of this century,\" Golbuu says, \"but before then we'll kill them with all the activities we do on land.\" Each year, Palau hosts more than 100,000 international tourists, over five times as many visitors as the nation has full-time residents. Even the most remote, pristine dive sites are ringed with tour boats.\n\nDevelopment projects, including a new highway that rings the large island of Babeldaob, are threats to the same inshore reefs that may be most resistant to climate change. A few Palauan reefs, which survived the '98 bleaching and might have been promising refugia candidates, have already been wiped out by the sand and dirt washing away from building projects.\n\nOn the day we spoke, Golbuu was weighing how to respond to the chief of Ngermid, the village bordering Nikko Bay. Palau's traditional chiefs, who wield what he calls considerable \"non-Western\" power in parallel to the country's modern political system, were very supportive of protecting Nikko Bay, he says, citing a concept called bul that provides the ethos for Palauan conservation. A bul , a moratorium on certain behaviors, can be used to let a tapped-out ecosystem rest. The local chief had requested details on why the place was special, but Golbuu was worried that the highly technical paper authored by Shamberger, the postdoc in Cohen's lab, would need some explaining.\n\nFor the most part, Golbuu is waiting to hear back from the state legislature. \"What I told them is right now Nikko Bay is treated like any other Rock Island in Palau,\" he says. \"But it's not. It's very special. So all we are asking you is: try to treat it differently.\"\n\nThe legislature is dragging its feet, but the efforts to raise awareness have already helped, Golbuu thinks. A legislator checked with him after hearing a proposal to bring some sort of tourist submarine into Nikko Bay. Not here, Golbuu recommended, and the proposal was rejected.\n\nAs Barkley and I finish picking at the remnants of our dishes, I put the same question to her that preoccupies Golbuu. Just how heartened should we be about Palau's special places? Can they last?\n\nBarkley brings up qualifiers. There's the dump near Nikko Bay, which may not be properly sealed. There's the sewage outflow. There are those tourists, she says, joking about them running the banana boat into the reefs. But if those threats can be contained and these corals protected, she says, \"they have probably the best chance of any of Palau's reefs of surviving climate change.\"\n\nThe Palauan Way\n\nGolbuu feels intimately connected to the corals he wants to save. During his childhood, the village kids would cut through the mangroves, swim across Nikko Bay, and climb the hill to the Continental Hotel, the first high-class tourist hotel in Palau. \"So we'll go up the dock, run up there, jump in their swimming pool and swim, and then they'll chase us,\" Golbuu says with a chortle, reminiscing. Then they'd jump off the dock and swim back to the village.\n\nNow Golbuu is an ambassador for Palau to the international scientific and conservation communities. He's full of pride for his country, its natural resources, and its people. Yes, saving the reef is an environmental issue, but he thinks Palauans, considering their traditional ways of life, are sufficiently motivated.\n\nFor them, the matter of saving their reefs goes beyond scientific literature and international conservation. They fish there. Palauan women gather sea cucumbers, and exchange carved sea turtle shells as IOUs. They benefit from ecotourism. They grind up coral rocks for building materials or use them to make chemical lime, which many Palauans add to betel nuts before chewing the blood-red mixture to get a mild high. \"Sometimes people forget why we're doing this, and they think that this is for some other people. No, it's for us,\" he says. \"This is our island. These are our fish.\" And corals and fish go hand in hand.\n\nIt's a complex sort of stewardship Golbuu advocates, a flexible awareness of how resources are shared and how much can be taken. And yet it seems fundamentally Palauan. On a rainy day, I tag along with Golbuu's employees Uly and Lincoln as they survey the corals and algae growing out on the barrier reef, north of Koror. At one site, while they're in the water, our Palauan boat driver Ben and I huddle together under a small canopy to stay dry.\n\nBen was a fisherman for 12 years, but couldn't take it anymore, he tells me. Catching fish to eat them doesn't bother him; neither does giving a few to the neighbors in hopes of a good turn later. But he could no longer stomach selling the flesh. Now most days he drives dive boats for tourists. In the last two years of being a fisherman, he felt exhausted. \"Every night, I prepare myself for killing,\" Ben says. \"I didn't plant that fish.\" He repeats himself. \"I didn't plant that fish. The coral made that.\"",

    "title": "Engineers Could Heatproof Tech With New 3D-Printed Material",
    "body": "Receive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.\n\nEmail AddressZip CodeSubscribe\n\nA new kind of 3D printed material could make technology more heat-resistant.\n\nUnlike most naturally occurring solids, these manmade, mesh-like materials shrink when they're heated up. By tweaking the materials' chemical composition, the researchers could control how much they shrank at different temperatures. This work could apply to everything from circuitry to dentistry.\n\nSupport Provided ByLearn More\n\nMany devices warp or break at high temperatures because they're made of metal, glass, or other normal solids that expand as they get hotter. Manufacturers can create sturdier devices if they incorporate some components that contract at higher heat, giving other pieces room to expand without breaking. But such shrinking solids are extremely rare. As a result, scientists have been trying since the mid-'90s to fabricate them in the lab.\n\nThe new 3D-printed \"lattices\" are grid-like structures mere millimeters across and are made up of tiny interlocking rods. Some of the rods are pure plastic; others are infused with copper nanoparticles. As they heat up, the pure-plastic beams swell faster than their copper-infused counterparts, bending in towards the center of the lattice and pulling the copper-reinforced rods along with them. This effectively causes the whole structure to crumple in on itself, said Qiming Wang, an engineer at the University of Southern California and lead author on the new study.\n\nTo test the lattices' shrinkage, Wang's team placed them inside a glass chamber and turned up the heat. As the chamber went from room temperature to 540 degrees Fahrenheit, the 3D-printed structures initially maintained their size and then gradually contracted. This work is described in Physical Review Letters .\n\nThe sugar-cube-sized lattices only shrink about the width of a human hair on each side, said Nick Fang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and coauthor on the new study. But even this small change in size could make a big difference to engineers using these materials to build high-precision optical and mechanical devices. \"This work is very innovative,\" said Akihiro Takezawa, an engineer at Hiroshima University who is unaffiliated with the project.\n\nRelatedA Twin Towers' Survivor StorySaving Venice From the SeaStable Isotopes in Forensics\n\nAccording to Takezawa, these materials could be especially useful because of their tunable quality. Wang's team could control how much the lattices shrank at different temperatures by changing how many nanoparticles they injected into the copper-infused rods. It's also possible to fine-tune the lattices' shrinkage by altering the width and orientation of their rods, Fang said.\n\nWang and his colleagues have proposed myriad uses for their new 3D-printed products. Take microchips, for example. When computers operate for a long time, they tend to heat up, which can cause their microchips to crack. Fashioning some microchip components that contract at higher temperatures could help computers withstand overheating. The researchers' current 3D-printing method could construct samples less than a millimeter across, \"so current technology is already good for microchip applications,\" Wang said.\n\nThe lattices could similarly be used to build sturdier drone cameras, Fang said. If a drone flies up even 10 meters on a hot summer day, the increased temperature can cause the camera lens to expand. A contracting frame around the lens could act as a buffer that would keep a swelling lens from breaking the camera.\n\nFang said that the new 3D-printed materials could even be used to make something as simple as a dental filling. Unlike normal metal or plastic fillings, non-expanding fillings wouldn't cause a toothache when the wearer drinks a hot beverage.\n\nThe lattices also might be used in ways that scientists haven't even considered yet, said Jonathan Berger, a mechanical engineer at the University of California, Santa Barbara who was not involved in the study. It's difficult to compile a full list of applications, he said, \"for these materials that theoretically you can do completely new things with.\"\n\nThe next step for Wang's team is to devise a speedier method of manufacturing lattices. Some of the biggest structures printed for this study -- each only a centimeter or so across -- took 12 hours to make. But Wang hopes that eventually 3D-printing will provide a cheap, relatively easy way for designers and engineers to produce tunable materials for more heat-resistant tech.\n\n\"It's a long road to travel to get these kinds of lattices into airplanes or circuit boards where there's a huge established industry,\" Berger said. \"But it'll be really exciting to see where this technology goes.\"",

    "body": "Receive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.\n\nEmail AddressZip CodeSubscribe\n\nWe recently bade farewell to the Cassini spacecraft , which after 13 years of faithfully orbiting Saturn and its moons was directed to plunge into the giant planet's atmosphere . The reason for the \"grand finale\" was to guard against the possibility that Cassini might crash into one of Saturn's moons -- in particular Enceladus.\n\nWith its curtain of geysers and internal ocean, Enceladus is unique. As a result, this small, icy moon is currently regarded as\n\nSupport Provided ByLearn More a potential host for life , and so no chance was taken that it might become contaminated by the Cassini spacecraft. Now new research, published in Nature Astronomy , suggests this ocean has existed within Enceladus for a very long time -- possibly long enough to create the conditions to develop life. RelatedA Primer of GemstonesThe Fate of Easter IslandGalileo's Big Mistake\n\nThe geysers are plumes of salty water-ice mixed with traces of carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and other hydrocarbons that erupt along cracks in Enceladus' south polar region. It was because of these geysers that scientists could work out that Enceladus must have an ocean below its icy crust and that the ocean is active (convecting). A subsequent observation that hydrogen was present in the plumes led to an additional conclusion, that hydrothermal activity -- chemical reactions due to the interaction of water and rock -- was taking place. But what scientists have failed to explain is what heat source could be powering this activity.\n\nAs more observations of the location of the plumes were made, the mystery of the missing heat source increased. The geysers are associated with features known as \"tiger stripes\" -- a set of four, parallel depressions, about 62 miles (100 km) long and 1,640 feet (500 m) deep. The temperature of the stripes is higher than that of the rest of the icy crust, so it was assumed that they must be cracks in the ice. There are almost no impact craters in the tiger stripes region, so it must be very young, of the order of a million-years-old . Any model that purported to explain the heat source had also to account for its focused nature -- the ocean is global, but why is only the south polar region active?\n\nFor several years, scientists have favoured the explanation of \"tidal heating\" -- a result of interactions between planetary-sized bodies. For instance tidal interaction with our own moon is responsible for the ebb and flow of water on Earth. Enceladus is in orbital resonance with the similar-sized moon Dione , which affects the shape of Enceladus' orbit around Saturn. The effect, however, is insufficient to account for the power required to keep the geysers active -- calculated to be in the order of 5GW. This would be sufficient power for a city the size of Chicago.\n\nPorous core\n\nResearchers came a step closer to solving the puzzle when they looked at the internal structure of Enceladus. The moon has a density low enough to imply mainly ice with a small, rocky core. This observation has been known for many years, ever since the Voyager 2 mission took the first images of Enceladus and determined its radius, so allowing its volume to be calculated. The gravitational tug of Enceladus on Cassini allowed the moon's mass to be estimated, giving a value for the density of the body . Gravity measurements by Cassini showed that the core also had a low density which could be interpreted as the core being porous , with the pores filled with ice.\n\nThe new series of calculations fills the core's pores with water, rather than ice, from which the authors show that tidal forces associated with the pore water are more than sufficient to explain how Enceladus' heat is generated. The model is impressive because it is so thorough -- considering not just the porosity of the core, but its permeability (how easily fluids can move through it) and how strong it is (will it shatter or flex as fluids run through it?). The researchers apply similar detail to the fluid, with consideration of its viscosity (how runny it is), temperature and composition, as well as its convective properties (how well can it transport heat).\n\nTaking all these parameters together and assigning either known or conservatively assessed values to them results in a fearsome complex of equations. Fortunately, the authors (or, at least, their computer software) can solve the equations to produce an elegant model of heat flow within Enceladus.\n\nThe authors create a 3D picture of where and how heat from tidal movements within the pore spaces is transferred to the sub-surface ocean. They find that heat dissipation from the core is not homogeneous, but appears as a series of interlinked, narrow upwellings where temperatures are in excess of 363 K (194\u00b0 F), with hotspots mainly at the south pole. Because the heat sources are so focussed, there would be increased hydrothermal activity associated with them -- explaining the hydrogen in the plumes.\n\nThe final exciting observation that comes from the model is that the amount of heat produced by the internal tide is sufficient to maintain Enceladus' subsurface ocean for billions of years. Prior to this, it was thought that if the heat source for a global sub-surface ocean had been radioactive decay, the ocean would freeze in a few million years , which is why tidal forces were suggested as a potential heat source. But again, there were problems with such a model, requiring changes in Enceladus' orbit -- and even so, an ocean would be, at best, transient.\n\nThis immediately leads to another set of questions: what does this imply for life on Enceladus? A warm global ocean with a lifetime of several billion years would be a great place for life to get going -- it only took about 640 million years for life to evolve from microbe to mammal on Earth. Unfortunately, though, Enceladus itself may be quite young: a recent paper proposed that the moon might only have formed about 100 million years ago -- is that a sufficiently long interval for life to have got going?\n\nIs there life beyond Earth? The solar system's ocean worlds might be the most promising place to look.\n\nPossibly -- life seems to have got going on Earth within a few hundred million years of its formation under much more severe circumstances of impact bombardment. Although it took a further 3.5 billion years or so to get to the dramatic expansion of life. Maybe it is the future that is looking bright for Enceladus -- if Enceladus' ocean has the potential to last for billions of years, then could a similar evolutionary sequence to that on Earth take place in the darkened depths of an Enceladen ocean? Perhaps no future dwarf planet of the apes -- but what price a mermaid?\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

    "title": "The Planet's Getting Warmer. Can Plants Take the Heat?",
    "body": "Today, in the journal PNAS, researchers report that rice plants are sensitive to the damaging effects of high heat even in the short term. Brief exposures to sweltering temperatures unraveled plant cells' messenger RNA -- a critical molecular envoy that ferries the instructions contained within DNA to the cell's protein-producing factories -- cuing the messages up for destruction. Though the rice eventually recovered, the new finding underscores just how sensitive plants may be to the hazards of a fast-warming world.\n\nWith each degree-Celsius increase in average global temperature, rice crop yields fall by about 3%. And as the planet warms and the human population expands, the gap between supply and demand for this staple crop continues to widen. But while these trends are clear at a macroscopic level, the inner workings of plant cells coping with toasty temperatures remain far less clear.\n\nTo better understand heat tolerance in crops, a team of scientists led by Zhao Su, a plant biologist at Pennsylvania State University, heated cuttings of young rice shoots (Oryza sativa) to a temperature of 42\u00ba Celsius (nearly 108\u00ba Fahrenheit) for 10 minutes. Though temporary, the mini heat wave constituted a rapid 20\u00ba-Celsius shift upwards from room temperature -- an escalation that's \"more than a human could ever withstand,\" explains study author Philip Bevilacqua, an RNA chemist also at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nWhen the researchers analyzed the shoots' cellular contents, they found that the temporary trauma had compromised the rice's ability to relay genetic information through their messenger RNA, or mRNA.\n\nPlants, like humans, store their genetic information in the form of DNA. Contained within this molecular manuscript are all the necessary instructions for growth and survival -- including all the cell's contingency plans for emergencies or unanticipated changes in the surrounding environments. The DNA manual is extremely comprehensive, so cells access excerpts from it on an as-needed basis, making short-lived photocopies of the original text in the form of mRNA. Without mRNA, cells can't receive the intel necessary to manufacture the building blocks necessary for life.\n\nBut for such a critical piece of the cellular puzzle, mRNA is frustratingly fickle. Unlike DNA, which is stored in two strands that lock into each other like the halves of a zipper, the synthesis of mRNA creates an unwieldy single-stranded molecule. These open-faced strands can loop around and bind to themselves in a semblance of secure structure, but this makeshift jumble is inherently far less durable than that of double-stranded DNA.\n\nBecause of mRNA's infamous instability, the scientists reasoned it might be particularly susceptible to suffering at high temperatures. When they dosed the rice cells with a chemical marker that tags single-stranded mRNA molecules, Su and his colleagues discovered that heated plants contained higher proportions of unfurled mRNA compared to shoots lounging at room temperature. The head and tail ends of many mRNA strands appeared particularly fragile, accruing more of the incriminating chemical tags. In the heat of the moment, it seemed, these cellular messengers were melting.",

    "body": "\"Standing in that cell... that's a level of stifling I've never experienced.\"\n\n\"They took one of the prisoners out from their cell, and I stood in that cell,\" recalls Vassallo, who grew up in Texas. \"Standing in that cell -- when all you have is Plexiglas, a little bit of a window, and very tight mesh -- you stand in that for 20 minutes, and even as a Texan used to the heat, that's a level of stifling I've never experienced.\"\n\nIndividuals with mental illness, who are disproportionately represented in America's criminal justice system, are at particular risk from rising temperatures. \"People with mental illness are four times more likely to die of heat related complications,\" Vassallo says. Medications used to treat psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety can compromise the body's way of maintaining a safe internal temperature. In Texas alone, 30,678 prisoners are on psychotropic medications, which limit the body's ability to cool itself down by sweating and suppress the brain's ability to perceive temperature changes -- meaning the body won't initiate compensatory behavioral changes, despite an individual feeling hotter.\n\nMore generally, cognitive function declines with exposure to extreme heat. In some cases, incarcerated people with severe mental disorders or cognitive impairments may have trouble exercising good judgment and carrying out typical behavioral adaptations to keep cool.\n\nMedications designed to treat underlying conditions, such as the hypertension medicine hydrochlorothiazide, also disrupt temperature regulation in the body. Plaintiffs in the McCollum wrongful death lawsuit said that Larry McCollum, who had weight-related health issues, was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide to treat his hypertension days before he died.\n\nThe prison system has a responsibility to protect the health of people in its care, Vassallo suggests. \"Even when [the criminal justice system] is serving its purpose, lawfully and fairly, the people who are going to prison -- they have the right to enter society with their health intact,\" she says.\n\nIn July 2017, Judge Ellison called for emergency steps to protect the Pack Unit plaintiffs. High cell temperatures in the prison, he said, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Six months later, in a settlement, TDCJ agreed to air condition the prison and offer medical accommodations to its population.\n\n\"I never dreamt we'd get the Pack Unit air-conditioned,\" the judge said at the time. A TDCJ spokesperson told NOVA, \"Offenders who have been found medically to be at the highest risk have already been moved to existing beds in air conditioned facilities.\"\n\nStill, not everyone viewed the settlement as a triumph. Jeffery Adams, a plaintiff who was deemed heat-sensitive because of medical conditions, was disappointed that the changes would not take effect in the rest of Texas, let alone the rest of the country.\n\n\"I don't like the way this issue is ending in the Fifth Circuit,\" wrote Adams, who is serving 15 years for robbery with a deadly weapon. \"What about the other 30,000 inmates on prison units throughout the state who are in the same danger?\"\n\nAcross the planet, temperatures are already soaring due to climate change.\n\n\"We don't have to talk about 50 years from now,\" says Dr. Marshall Shepherd, a leading international climate expert and the 2013 President of the American Meteorological Society. \"The heat waves we're seeing around the globe -- in India, in Europe -- they already have the DNA of climate change in them.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Shepherd says, \"We're going to see more intense and frequent heat waves.\" Currently, 30 percent of the world's population experiences at least 20 days per year when the temperature crosses a \"deadly\" threshold. But according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at current rates, this percentage is projected to climb to 74 percent of the global population by 2100.\n\n\"Imagine being in a prison environment under a heatwave that's been lingering for a week or two, and the nighttime temperatures aren't getting too cool,\" said Shepherd. \"That's when you start seeing heat-related trauma.\"",

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nPlacemats can liven up your dining room decor while also protecting your dining room table from food spills and water stains. Cultiver makes our favorite placemats with its classic, simple linen fabric that's easy to wash.\n\nDoes anything say adulthood quite like evolving beyond placing your plates directly on your kitchen table? You're a sophisticated grown-up keen on preserving your reclaimed wood or sleek glass tabletop, which is why you've invested in placemats. Both aesthetically pleasing and functional, placemats are undoubtedly a staple of any well-meaning kitchen. Because you weren't raised in a barn.\n\nWhen thinking about how to enter adulthood and purchase your first set of placemats, you'll want to keep a few things in mind. First and foremost, what material are you most drawn to? Different materials will serve different purposes, and be either more or less easy to keep clean. For example, if you're intrigued by a linen placemat, you'll want to consider that they'll be considerably harder to reuse between washes than, say, a plastic or wooden placemat.\n\nAlong a similar vein, you'll want to think about how often you're hoping to use your placemats. Indeed, you may want to have one set for everyday use, and another for guest appearances.\n\nAlso key to consider will be your color scheme and pattern preference. Placemats can make quite the statement in an otherwise monochromatic dining space, so take this as your opportunity to introduce some color into your life.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Lekker makkelijk zo'n verspakket van Jumbo of Albert Heijn, maar is het goedkoper dan de ingredi\u00ebnten los kopen?\n\nYou may also want to keep in mind the temperature of your average bowl or plate - if you tend to serve hot soup rather than cold salads, you may need a placemat that is capable of standing up to warmer foods.\n\nFinally, as ever, you'll want to consider price points. While placemats probably won't ever be the most expensive items in your kitchen, some are certainly more expensive than others. But regardless which of our favorite placemats you choose to try, we're certain you won't go wrong.\n\nHere are the best placemats you can buy: Best placemats overall: Cultiver Linen Placemats Best protective placemats for your table: Pauwer Placemats Best decorative placemats: Benson Mills Pressed Vinyl Placemat Best placemat for kids: UpwardBaby Silicone Placemat Best alternative material placemats: Coconut Twig Placemats Read on in the slides below to check out our top picks. The best placemats overall\n\nFoto: sourceCultiver Why you'll love them: Cultiver's classic linen placemats are beautiful, easy to care for, and durable.\n\nYou may know Cultiver best for its beautiful linen bedding, but the company is here to prove that linen belongs everywhere in your home - including the kitchen and dining room. If you're looking for a set of placemats that are elegant and sophisticated, yet surprisingly long-lasting and easy to care for, Cultiver has an answer for you.\n\nThe linen construction of these placemats lends a sense of style to any kitchen or dining table. They drape easily and are just as appropriate for a small family meal as they are for a more formal get-together. These placemats are woven from European flax and pre-washed for maximum softness. They are double-layered in order to protect your table and also protect themselves from heavy usage.\n\nI love that you can mix and match these placemats with Cultiver's linen napkins, adding surprising pops of color to your table setting. And while you won't find any crazy patterns or neon colors from Cultiver, you will find six classic hues - white, smoke grey, charcoal grey, navy, natural, and blush. All placemats are 43 by 58 centimeters or 17 by 23 inches.\n\nWhile these placemats are admittedly quite expensive at $60 for a set of four, their durability and beautiful design make them well worth the extra money.\n\nPros: Beautiful colors, pre-washed softness, elegant for both casual and formal settings, great color selection\n\nCons: At $15 a pop, these aren't cheap\n\nBuy a set of four Cultiver linen placemats for $60 The best protective placemats for your table\n\nFoto: sourcePAUWER Why you'll love them: If your primary purpose in purchasing placemats is to protect your table, then Pauwer Placemats are the way to go.\n\nThere's a reason Pauwer Placemats are among the best-selling options on Amazon. Not only are they affordable at just $10 for a set of four, but they're also made from a heat-resistant PVC material. That means that if you're putting down a particularly hot plate or steaming bowl, you won't need to worry about leaving a mark on your table.\n\nWhile you shouldn't test the heat resistant qualities of the PVC, Pauwer notes that its high-quality placemat is actually flame retardant. Plus, the vinyl is easy to clean. In fact, you don't even need to throw these placemats through the wash. Simply wipe them down when you're done with your meal, and let them live to see another day.\n\nPauwer placemats also dry surprisingly quickly, so after you take a sponge to these guys, you won't have to let them air out for hours on end. Rather, I've generally rolled them up and put them away shortly thereafter, and haven't had to deal with any mildewy or moldy smells upon my next usage. Because these placemats are so flexible, they're also exceedingly easy to store.\n\nThese mats come in sets of four, six, and eight, and while each one is 17.7 by 11.8 inches, you can trim them down easily to be the appropriate size and shape for your table, should you need to. There are also 10 colors and designs to choose from for maximal customization.\n\nPros: Heat-resistant, protective, easy to clean, affordable, wide range of colors\n\nCons: These placemats slip around a bit, but you can put another placemat beneath them to stop that\n\nBuy a set of 4 Pauwer Placemats on Amazon for $9.99 (price varies by color) The best decorative placemats\n\nFoto: sourceBenson Mills Why you'll love them: If you're looking to make a statement with your placemats, the Benson Mills Blossom Pressed Vinyl Placemats will help you do just that.\n\nIf you tend to have trouble getting the conversation going around your dinner table, you could get a set of placemats that are conversation starters in and of themselves.

Made of pressed vinyl, they're not only easy on the eyes, but easy to clean as well with a sponge or damp cloth.\n\nOf course, these placemats are intended for use at your kitchen or dining room table, but I've also found that they make beautiful settings for vases, decorative plates, and a wide range of other trinkets that need just a little bit of extra elegance to help them look their best. And thanks to their affordable price point, you can certainly grab a few extra sets to use around the house.\n\nNearly 200 customers on Amazon have given these placemats 4.7 out of 5 stars, with one happy reviewer noting, \"I purchased these silver placemats to complete my dining room table for Christmas. They're perfect! They look beautiful both on the table cloth or on the bare wood table.\"\n\nThe placemats come in five different colors and designs, so you can mix and match based on your aesthetic.\n\nPros: Beautiful, unique design, affordable price point, vinyl makes for easy cleaning and caring\n\nCons: Because of the webbed design, these aren't the best for keeping liquid off your table\n\nBuy the Benson Mills Pressed Vinyl Placemat on Amazon for $10.99 The best placemat for kids\n\nFoto: sourceUpwardBaby Why you'll love them: When you have a new baby or young kid in the house, you may want to protect your surfaces with the UpwardBaby Silicone Placemats.\n\nAs cute as your child may be, the mess that he or she creates at every meal time is less than adorable. Luckily, you can make cleaning up said mess a bit easier by investing in a set of UpwardBaby Silicone Placemats. Not only are these mats surprisingly cute, what with their cloud shape, but they're also both baby-proof and baby safe.\n\nThe three-piece set is made of non-slip 100% BPA-free silicone, which means that it'll stay in place throughout mealtime, and won't harm your child if he or she decides to try to make it part of the meal. For extra stickiness, you could also try wetting the bottom of these mats.\n\nSupremely lightweight and easy to transport, this set is great to take on the go. So if you're visiting grandma and grandpa and hoping for a return invitation, you might want to bring the UpwardBaby placemats along with you.\n\nEach set comes with a gray, a blue, and a green placemat, and measures 11 by 3 by 3 inches. While that's not sizable enough for an adult, it's quite fitting for a child. And when you're done using them, you can just throw them in the dishwasher for the easiest cleanup imaginable.\n\nAmazon reviewers have given this set 4.4 out of 5 stars, with happy parents noting that these are some of the most frequently used items in their baby toolkit.\n\nAs one reviewer noted, \"These mats are awesome! As a parent of two young kids that love to be outdoors, the heavy duty mats provide a barrier between dropped food and dirty picnic tables, resulting in less waste. I really like how easy they are to roll up, take out, use, and clean up.\"\n\nPros: 100% BPA-free silicone construction, dishwasher-safe, non-slip, great size for kids\n\nCons: These aren't the most multifunctional placemats, as they work pretty much exclusively for your kids\n\nBuy a set of three UpwardBaby Silicone Placemats on Amazon for $28.97 The best alternative material placemats\n\nFoto: sourceCost Plus World Market Why you'll love them: These wooden placemats available at World Market are a great favorite among interior designers, and with their unique aesthetic, it's not hard to see why.\n\nIf you're tired of silicone, linen, or vinyl placemats, you may consider laying some wood on your table instead. The Coconut Twig Placemats from World Market are an unexpected addition to your kitchen or dining room table that just might make you the talk of the town.\n\nThese placemats are favorites among the folks at New York Magazine, and as interior designer Matthew Smyth told the publication, \"I love the handsome rustic look of these placemats. It can be the perfect backdrop for simple Japanese stoneware or it can tone down and highlight formal French faience dinner plates. Mixing both on top works well also!\"\n\nMade in the Philippines, this set of four is made of real coconut twigs tied together with cotton fiber. Each is 13 inches by 19 inches, which means that they'll actually going to cover a fair amount of surface area on your table.\n\nThey also pair well with the entire Coconut Twig Table Linen Collection from World Market, which includes a $10 runner that will certainly add some rustic charm to your home decor.\n\nWhile you can't throw these placemats in the dishwasher, you can just wipe them down with a damp cloth, which makes for pretty straightforward cleaning. Plus, these mats actually do a surprisingly good job at keeping liquid and food particles off your table and are relatively heat resistant, too.\n\nPros: Unique aesthetic, extremely affordable, easy to care for, heat resistant\n\nCons: Wood isn't quite as easy to store as other materials, may be a bit less durable than man-made materials\n\nBuy the Coconut Twig Placemats from World Market for $7.92",

Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain when the pasta is still al dente; do not overcook!\n\n2. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun spice (or more) over the chicken cubes. Toss around to coat. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Add half the chicken in a single layer; do not stir. Allow the chicken to brown on one side, about 1 minute. Flip to the other side and cook an additional minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Remove the chicken, leaving the skillet on high heat. Add the remaining butter and olive oil. When heated, add the garlic, peppers and onions. Sprinkle on the remaining Cajun spice, and add salt if needed. Cook over high heat for 1 minute, stirring gently and trying to get the vegetables as dark/black as possible. Add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Remove all the vegetables from the skillet.\n\n3. With the skillet still over high heat, pour in the chicken broth and wine. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour in the cream, stirring/whisking constantly. Cook the sauce over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until the cream starts to thicken the mixture. Taste and add freshly ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, and/or salt to taste. The sauce should be spicy!\n\n4. Finally, add the chicken and vegetables to the sauce, making sure to include all the juices that have drained onto the plate. Stir and cook until the mixture is bubbly and hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the drained fettuccine and toss to combine.",

    "title": "Lowe's 10 things: Doncic, Paul George and CP3 swagger",
    "body": "Paul's shooting hasn't come all the way around during the Houston Rockets' climb into the Western Conference's No. 4 spot, but he has his quick-strike swagger back:\n\nWhat a freaking genius. Look at what Paul sees -- or at least what we can see of Paul's passing angle -- when he slingshots this baby to Eric Gordon:\n\nI mean, come on.\n\nPaul isn't as fast as he once was. He can't blow by defenders -- including big guys on switches -- as easily as he could even last season. He's not a leaper. But when he's healthy, Paul snaps from a standstill into a high-speed lunge with alarming suddenness. He moves in sync with the ball on defense, or even just before the passer releases it. He is almost always anticipatory, not reactive. His brain makes his body faster.\n\nPaul is doing his best work when James Harden rests. The Rockets have outscored opponents by 11 points per 100 possessions in those minutes, and that number has been even beefier -- about 17 points -- since Paul's return from injury in late January. He has a massively positive effect on Houston's wobbly transition defense, a consistent trend through Paul's career, per Cleaning The Glass.\n\nHouston's best lineups haven't quite clicked, even during this streak. The Rockets are about even for the season when Harden and Paul share the floor, and their starting group -- Paul, Harden, Gordon, the indomitable PJ Tucker and Clint Capela -- has been a net negative.\n\nThat will change if Paul keeps playing this way.\n\nA stat that might surprise: The Utah Jazz have destroyed opponents by about 14 points per 100 possessions when Ingles and Favors play without all three of Ricky Rubio, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, per NBA.com. Ingles has become Utah's de facto backup point guard, and he and Favors have developed a nimble chemistry in the pick-and-roll:\n\nFavors is cagey disguising the direction of his screen. Ingles flips from fast to slow -- or perhaps slow to less slow -- depending on how much time Favors needs to roll deep into the paint, or what tactic would crack open the widest passing lane:\n\nBoth can hit floaters or midrange jumpers. Ingles keeps help defenders guessing until the very last second. He has a fake for every part of his body -- eye fakes, pump fakes, and the meanest pass fake since Manu Ginobili was spinning big guys around like tops. It wouldn't surprise me if Ingles has some sort of nose fake we don't know about.\n\nFavors, meanwhile, is enjoying perhaps his best two-way season. He has canned 64 percent of his 2-pointers. He is healthy and cramming on fools again. Opponents have hit just 48.6 percent of their shots at the rim with Favors nearby, the lowest such figure among 151 players who challenge at least two such shots per game.\n\nZoom out farther, and opponents have an effective field-goal mark 9.2 percentage points lower than expected -- based on the location of each shot -- when Favors is the nearest defender, the stingiest figure among all rotation players, per Second Spectrum tracking data. Yowza.\n\nThe Favors-Gobert combo might not work over heavy minutes, or in crunch time, but Favors is essential to the Jazz anyway (for now). The Ingles/Kyle Korver/Royce O'Neale/Jae Crowder/Favors group has become a fixture of Quin Snyder's rotation.\n\nAfter falling to the fringes of the Miami Heat's rotation, Olynyk has re-emerged as a crucial cog and starter as the capped-out Heat try to salvage a third straight blah season. The king of the slow-motion pump-and-drive is averaging 15 points since Feb. 1 on 54 percent shooting -- including 47 percent from deep.\n\nThe Heat have outscored opponents by about five points per 100 possessions when Olynyk and Bam Adebayo -- their current starting big-man duo -- share the floor, and even the maligned Olynyk-Hassan Whiteside pairing has surged over the past month. Olynyk is a heady sort, and he's doing his best to chase opposing power forwards on defense so Adebayo and Whiteside can hang near the rim.\n\nWith Goran Dragic hurting and Wayne Ellington a tax casualty, the Heat sorely need the threat of Olynyk's jump shot to stress defenses. He's also delightfully patient around the rim, holding his pivot foot and staying low as shot-blockers fly around him -- and using all three seconds of allotted paint time:\n\nHe's like Little Mac in there dodging punches until it's safe to strike.\n\nThe Heat are only 6-7 since reinserting Olynyk into the starting lineup, but he has helped them stay afloat amid injuries. Olynyk has cracked the 20-point barrier in four of Miami's past six games, including recent wins over Brooklyn and Charlotte with huge playoff implications.\n\nWe hearty souls who have been foraging atop Julius Randle Hill for years always knew he could score, trample entire defenses on the fast break, and dish canny assists when he wasn't getting a little hoggy. It has been nice seeing him flourish as a 20-point scorer with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nBut there is some trepidation in the Hill community -- more populous now -- given that Randle's ascension on offense has come at the expense of his work on the other end. Some of that is New Orleans shoehorning Randle into defending stretchy power forwards. He just does not have the fast-twitch speed or attention to detail for it:\n\nHe is often late dipping into the paint to help, meaning he is also late darting back out:\n\nRandle is still moving toward the paint when Avery Bradley's pass to Danilo Gallinari is airborne in the other direction. That is death.\n\nRandle hasn't fared much better protecting the rim. He is 451st among 494 players in the defense-only version of ESPN's real plus-minus -- a stat that often makes big men appear better than they are (hi, DeAndre Jordan.) He is dead last among centers.\n\nWe will not lose hope! Randle's numbers defending the pick-and-roll are fine, per Second Spectrum. When Randle digs in, he can be a deterrent at the rim and (kinda) switch across all five positions. He is probably best suited as a switchable small-ball center, but building a roster in which he can play that role as a starter will be tough.\n\nThe only thing that really matters from Doncic's sensational rookie season is Doncic proving he can already run a good offense. He is a passing savant with a jump shot and preternatural footwork.\n\nHe will become a decent defender, and perhaps even a very good one, as he gets in better shape. He's big and smart -- a good rebounder who already locks in during crunch time.\n\nBut in Year 2, Doncic needs to tighten up his off-ball work:\n\nHe has a tendency to get lost in no-man's land -- to turn his back on shooters, and dither into help position without actually helping anyone.\n\nThere is no point crashing the paint on the pick-and-roll if you do it late, at half-speed, and give the opposing big man a love tap:\n\nDoncic's positional versatility has been more shield than sword on defense; it gives Dallas more flexibility hiding him on non-threatening players as if he's a late-career Lakers star.\n\nDoncic will be fine on defense, and he's already a stud on the other end. Reminder: He gets to play with Kristaps Porzingis next season!\n\nA little guy busting out a long-distance up-and-under is one of the coolest, most relatable NBA things:\n\nGo to work, D.J. Augustin! That is a normal person driveway move. That is a move you use when you can't blow by anyone, and I say that from personal experience. (If the defender stays down, I'll need some help, please.)\n\nJayson Tatum isn't a little guy, but that just means he can traverse longer distances with a single pivot move:\n\n(As a Tatum-related aside, I like this lineup for the Boston Celtics: Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Tatum and Aron Baynes/Daniel Theis. The Baynes version has killed it so far. The Celtics should never rest Tatum, Kyrie Irving and Al Horford at the same time. Such lineups don't have quite enough shooting. If Irving and Horford are on the bench, Tatum should be on the floor.)\n\nWe think of the up-and-under as a post move. Kevin McHale, of course, is the all-time master. It's fun to see perimeter guys improvise with it farther from the hoop.\n\nAndrew Wiggins is the current captain of the \"It's Just Not Happening\" team, but Minnesota Timberwolves fans have been through enough.\n\nChriss has somehow regressed in Year 3, and playing real minutes with the Cleveland Cavaliers has made things worse. I'm not sure there is any player more out of sorts on offense. He's shooting 28 percent on 3-pointers and 46 percent on 2-pointers. His fouls and turnovers have spiked in the manner of someone who is still a beat behind processing the game.\n\nThe Suns eased Chriss into some playmaking duty from the elbows, and at times, he looked comfortable there. Not now. He commits illegal screens on handoffs, and throws passes that are too late or off-target:\n\nHe just runs into dudes in traffic:\n\nHelp defenders seem to surprise him. He doesn't have a Plan B. Perhaps most distressing: Chriss travels a lot -- in the post, when he tries to pump-and-drive, even just triggering run-of-the-mill dribble moves.\n\nChriss should be an NBA player. Let's hope he finds a stable path there.\n\nMan, some of these refs have short fuses. On Sunday, Trae Young was tossed for staring down Kris Dunn after canning a triple. Nine days earlier in Atlanta, officials ejected Blake Griffin after two weak technicals -- the second of which came when Griffin yapped at the Hawks bench after drilling a sideline 3-pointer.\n\nThis season has featured quick-trigger technicals against Lance Stephenson for strumming his air guitar after a 3-pointer that put the Lakers up 32 points in Charlotte; and against Clint Capela for a very quick swing on the rim.\n\nThe Young and Stephenson techs show the lingering influence of the Malice at the Palace. The league understandably fears late-game taunting in blowouts -- the kind of rubbing-it-in-the-face that might infuriate a frustrated player on the trailing team. Ditto for staredowns between players who have already been warned about tense encounters -- as Young and Dunn were Sunday.\n\nBut can we chill a little with second technicals? The league is lucky Detroit rallied to win in Atlanta without Griffin. The Pistons are leading a semi-heated playoff race. Every game matters. Griffin is their best player. You can't eject him from a late-season game for talking trash.\n\nIf we are going to needle refs for being against fun, we should also acknowledge that the league has eradicated Hack-a-Shaq. There have been only 33 intentional away-from-the-play fouls this season, putting the league on pace for about 45 such hacks -- down from 77 last season, 126 the year before, and an unwatchable 420 in 2015-16, per league figures released to ESPN.com.\n\nAfter that season, the league extended the harsh late-game penalties for such fouls -- one free throw and the ball -- over the last two minutes of every quarter. Meanwhile, the league's two main Hack-a targets -- Andre Drummond and DeAndre Jordan -- have improved their free throw shooting to the point that the strategy no longer makes sense against them. Two other candidates -- Dwight Howard and Andre Roberson -- have been injured all or most of this season.\n\nLonzo Ball -- shooting a preposterous 41.7 percent on free throws -- is hurt, too. Downturns for D.J. Wilson (11-of-28), OG Anunoby (21-of-44) and Steven Adams (53 percent) are probably random. That leaves one guy to monitor: Hassan Whiteside, shooting 44 percent after hitting at least 60 percent in each of the past three seasons. If he stabilizes, we might be in the Hack-a-Shaq clear until Roberson returns.\n\nNext up: banning the clotheslines and wrap-ups that abort fast breaks.\n\nThis guy is either super-committed to his job, or a little reckless -- or both.\n\nIf D'Angelo Russell throws a bounce pass to Rodions Kurucs, our mopper -- belly-flopping into a double-towel breaststroke -- might accidentally intercept it. Our guy loves his area of the floor. He dotes on it like Kramer picking up trash along his highway mile. He will risk bodily harm to keep his territory pristine.\n\nThe best mopper-related drama happens when they venture farther onto the floor with actual mops during live action, and the offensive team coughs the ball up -- leading to a fast break coming right at the poor court-wipers. They have to pick up those mops and rush back to the baseline. You can see the terror in their eyes.\n\nSo much of good defense lives in the absence of anything happening. Witness these six seconds of nothing -- but everything -- from George:\n\nHe navigates a Nikola Jokic screen untouched, and then blocks the passing lane between Jokic and Malik Beasley. Jokic nudges past Steven Adams, but George lingers in the lane to stop him. Perhaps he has strayed too far, and stayed too long. Jokic pings the ball to Beasley in the corner. George is already moving there before the ball is out of Jokic's hands, and he's fast enough and long enough to get back to Beasley.\n\nIt can appear as if George is cavalier with shooters -- as if he has left them too open. But it's really that he knows exactly how much time his length and athleticism buy him, and how to exploit every millisecond of that time.\n\nGeorge closes out on Beasley without losing his balance, or flying by him. Beasley has nothing. Denver starts from scratch.\n\nGeorge will never challenge as many raw shot attempts as the big men jostling with him for Defensive Player of the Year. That is inherent in the positional differences between wings and bigs. But you wonder how much sequences like these define what kinds of shots those big men end up challenging -- who shoots them, from where, and under what level of pressure from both the defense and the shot clock.",

    "title": "The secret to washing your clothes the right way",
    "body": "The little laundry symbols found on clothing tags aren't just suggestions. They're basically your user's manual for how to take care of your garment so it lasts as long as possible.\n\nIgnoring these icons can leave you with shrunken, discolored or mangled clothes. Here's what the most common laundry symbols mean on your clothing's care label, so you can clean them effectively and safely on laundry day.\n\nThe wash basin icon is basically a tub with water in it. If you see it on the label, that means your clothing item can be washed. If it's crossed out, then your garment can't be washed, and typically needs to be dry cleaned.\n\nThat seems simple, right? Well, a wash basin icon can come with many extra markings, as shown in the illustration above.\n\nLet's break all of those extras down:\n\nThese symbols help decode which fabrics can withstand the washing process, which can ruin delicate fabric.\n\nJust like with the basin symbol, if you see an iron symbol with the care instructions it means you can iron the garment, while a crossed out icon means you can't. Then, there are variations.\n\nDots inside the icon tell you which heat setting to use. If you see one dot inside of an iron icon, that means you need to use a low heat setting. Two dots means you should use a medium heat setting and three dots indicates a high heat setting, usually for cotton or linen fabric.\n\nLines are important, too. Lines coming from the bottom of the iron icon means that you can steam the garment. Lines crossed out below the iron means the garment can't be steamed.\n\nThe laundry symbols for drying in a dryer is a square with a circle in it, or sometimes just a circle. If you see the dryer symbol crossed out, don't put your clothing item in the dryer. It may shrink or be damaged by the heat. Typically, it's best to let these items air dry.\n\nKeep an eye out for dots. A tumble dry symbol with a dot in the center means that the item can tumble dry using the normal heat setting. Two dots means the item can be tumble dried on high heat. An empty circle means you can use any temperature setting.\n\nAlso, pay attention to whether the icon is colored-in or not. If you see a colored-in dryer icon, it means you need to tumble dry the item without heat.\n\nMany people just assume, if a garment is white, it can be bleached. Hold up there, buddy. Make sure to check the label first.\n\nAn open triangle means you can go ahead and use bleach, but a triangle with lines through it (like the middle triangle, above) means you should use nonchlorine bleach. A triangle that is crossed out means bleach of any sort is a bad idea and should be avoided.\n\nA circle with a letter inside means an item needs to be taken to a dry cleaner. The letter lets the dry cleaner know what kind of cleaning process your garment needs. You don't need to know what the letters mean, but you should never ignore these symbols and throw a garment in the washer anyway.",

    "title": "Here's the rocket science behind SpaceX Dragon 2's nail-biting landing",
    "body": "As space becomes more commercialised in 10 years, what's next for SpaceX?\n\nIf all goes to plan, a fiery Dragon will light up the sky over the Atlantic before hopefully cooling off with a watery splashdown on March 8. The SpaceX Dragon 2 capsule is of enormous significance for spaceflight as it has just become the first commercial vehicle to automatically dock with the International Space Station (ISS), and aims to carry astronauts there in a few months. Now it faces one of the most hazardous parts of its mission - returning to Earth safely.\n\nThe ISS, and the now docked Dragon 2 capsule, are currently orbiting at a speed of 27,600km per hour, about 400km above the surface of the Earth. To give an orbiting object a safe landing, which is clearly particularly important if it is to carry astronauts, this enormous speed needs to be reduced to approximately zero as it reaches the Earth's surface.\n\nThis change in velocity is going to come from a mixture of rocket firing, friction, air drag, parachutes and finally water. A crucial aspect of achieving it is calculating what angle to bring the object in at through the atmosphere. The velocity of any object in orbit is the product of two components, one moving towards the centre of the Earth and the other in the direction of its orbit. So when the spacecraft reenters the atmosphere, its motion will be a combination of these.\n\nThe first step in getting Dragon 2 home is to slow the orbital speed of the spacecraft down. This will be achieved by firing rockets against the direction of travel, steepening the angle of motion (see diagram below) until it dips into the denser regions of the atmosphere. The change in velocity required is in fact very small - one needs only to decelerate by roughly a 60th of the station's speed. The Earth's atmosphere will then do the rest.\n\nBut the angle of entering the atmosphere matters. If it's too steep, the capsule will experience excessive deceleration. If it's too shallow, there will not be enough drag force to slow the craft down sufficiently for landing. It is even possible to end up skipping the spacecraft along the atmosphere, like skimming a stone on a pond. Therefore, the spacecraft needs to travel within a narrow range of possible angles called the \"entry corridor\".\n\nAs the capsule comes through the atmosphere, it will be pushing its way through increasingly dense air. This causes friction around the outside of the spacecraft, heating it up. Fundamentally, the physical process involved is a conversion of energy from kinetic (movement) to thermal (heat). The high reentry speeds also produce a shock wave in front of the spacecraft which heats the air to thousands of degrees. This is similar to air heating up in a bicycle pump as it is compressed. The heat generated can be higher than the melting point of the metals in the skin of the spacecraft, so a good heat insulator needs to be present to protect it.\n\nThe Dragon spacecraft uses a carbon-based thermal protection system - a layer of ablative material which burns away, protecting the spacecraft.\n\nThe importance of heat shielding was highlighted during the Columbia Shuttle incident, in which a tile was damaged on take off, resulting in the shuttle disintegrating upon reentry and killing the crew members.\n\nThe heat generated will also depend on the entry angle. If the angle is too steep, the heat generated by the shockwave and friction at the front of the spacecraft will overwhelm the shielding, potentially causing the spacecraft to break apart or explode. Having said that, if all goes well, the advanced heat shielding materials used on Dragon 2 are expected to withstand hundreds of atmospheric reentry flights.\n\nRapid deceleration also generates strong g-force. These are the forces you feel acting on your body during acceleration, such as on a roller coaster. One g is the equivalent to the pull of Earth's gravity. In a standard Soyuz landing, astronauts experience up to about 6g. In one of the most extreme Soyuz landings in 2008, astronauts experienced over 8g, resulting in breathing difficulties and spinal compression for the crew.\n\nThe human body has a limited tolerance to g-forces - most people will pass out at a sustained acceleration of 7g. As the Dragon 2 is designed to be the first commercial passenger spacecraft, the deceleration forces and heat tolerances must be demonstrably within safe limits on this test run.\n\nTo test this safety for new astronauts, the Dragon 2 launch has a brave passenger. Ripley is a mannequin who is sat in one of the crew seats and will take data such as the internal temperature, pressure and g-forces experienced. This will ultimately determine if the reentry is safe for humans.\n\nOnce deceleration due to friction has slowed the spacecraft sufficiently, the remaining velocity will be shed with a combination of parachutes and a splashdown in the Atlantic. When the Dragon 2 is ready to be crewed, the recovery procedure will likely be similar to the US missions of the 1960s and 70s. The capsule will float in the ocean and the astronauts are then picked up by ship or helicopter. Historically, this wait time for the crew has been anywhere between 30 and 90 minutes.\n\nEarlier designs for the Dragon 2 incorporated a powered landing, involving slowing down with rockets, similar to the recent Falcon-heavy booster rocket landings. But this is more costly and can be more dangerous.\n\nWhile the softer landing in water has its benefits, an alternative is to return to land. This is the approach being taken by Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, which will use a combination of parachutes and airbags to reduce its landing velocity. The Starliner has its first ISS rendezvous test flight planned for next month, also unmanned.\n\nLike the Starliner, the Soyuz capsules (which have been running since the late 1960s) return to land. But they use small braking rockets at the last possible second to soften the landing, and are the most long-lived and successful spacecraft to date.\n\nThe landing and recovery of the Dragon 2 will represent a crucial milestone in commercial space flight. If successful, it will be the first time that a private company has flown a human-rated spacecraft to orbit, docked with the ISS and returned it safely to Earth. If it succeeds, it will make a second test trip in July with NASA astronauts on board. Such an achievement will hopefully greatly improve our prospects for further human space exploration.",

    "body": "The majority of NBA talk here in Los Angeles this week has concerned the Lakers' depressing slide from playoff contention. (Although, to be fair, if LeBron James had pushed this misshapen Lakers roster even to the eighth seed ... I would have notched it as one of his great accomplishments).\n\nBut the Lakers aren't the only bubble team that is losing their grip on playoff contention. This is the turn in the NBA schedule where a handful of teams begin to slide from that range of 10 percent-postseason odds down to less than one percent.\n\nIf you take a look at the current ESPN.com BPI playoff odds, you'll find that there are seven teams lodged between a one percent and a 55 percent chance of making the postseason: Minnesota Timberwolves, New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Hornets, Orlando Magic and Miami Heat. (Out of those squads, the Hornets, Magic and Heat are in a tight race for the Eastern Conference's eighth seed.)\n\nDuring the next week or two, many of these teams will see their playoff odds dwindle to the 0.1 percent range. As their hopes fade, they'll join the ranks of the teams already playing to collect ping-pong balls in the Zion Sweepstakes: New York Knicks, Phoenix Suns, Chicago Bulls, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAs you know, tanking teams are Fantasyland's greatest post-fake-trade-deadline source of new sources of statistical goodness. If you're a serious fantasy enthusiast, you've already mined the current tanking teams for fresh faces such as Trae Young, Kelly Oubre Jr., Mitchell Robinson and Dewayne Dedmon.\n\nToday, I'm going to examine the seven teams still on the playoff bubble, and earmark some of their players who might help fantasy managers down the stretch.\n\nJonathan Isaac, SF/PF, Orlando Magic\n\nNow this is the Isaac I drafted back in October. Isaac has long teased 1+1+1 potential, but he's surged since the end of January, averaging 13.1 PPG, 6.3 REB, 1.8 3PG, 1.9 BPG, and 0.9 SPG. Over the same span, he shot 37.8% from deep and 81.3% from the line.\n\nIsaac is gaining the kind of momentum that points toward classic late-season fantasy bloomer. The biggest reason his fantasy portfolio is starting to come together: shooting. After shooting just 40.0 percent from the field in January, Isaac turned it on in February, boosting his FG% to 49.1 percent. He's always been a solid free throw shooter (for a big), so now that his outside shot has arrived, Isaac stands to be a plus-player in terms of true shooting percentage.\n\nAll that's missing going forward? Rebounding. A player with Isaac's length, averaging close to 30 MPG, shouldn't be struggling to crack 6.0 RPG. But Isaac is arriving in a hurry. If you're in a keeper situation, you should stampede to your waiver wire and see if he's somehow still available in your league.\n\nKelly Olynyk, PF/C, Miami Heat\n\nOver the past 15 days, Olynyk has posted top-20 overall value with 9.86 Player Rater points. He just went for 22 points, 11 rebounds, 5 3s, 2 steals and a block against the Hornets. (Even more hopeful: the fact that Olynyk went numerically nuts while playing alongside the just-returned Hassan Whiteside). Yet somehow, he's still available in nearly 90 percent of leagues.\n\nSince moving into the starting lineup a couple of weeks ago, Olynyk has averaged 20.0 PPG and 3.0 3PG. The Heat are fighting tooth and nail for that eighth seed in the East, and it's possible that Erik Spolestra has decided Olynyk has become an inescapable aspect of his playoff push. Since he qualifies at center, Olynyk's efficiency-packed offensive late-season line could help a lot of deep-league fantasy teams in the playoffs.\n\nBobby Portis, PF, Washington Wizards\n\nRemember those \"Free Bobby Portis\" mantras from a couple of seasons ago? Well, Portis has finally found temporary freedom in D.C. In nine games with the Wizards, Portis has averaged 27.3 MPG, 15.3 PPG, 8.9 REB, 1.8 3PG, 1.1 SPG, and (a still-paltry) 0.2 BPG. His scoring has been paced by an impressive 43.2 3FG%. The Wizards have the rest of the season to probably decide between keeping Portis or Thomas Bryant. Portis seems to have the momentum, having started the past four games (and averaging a near double-double).\n\nFrank Kaminsky, C, Charlotte Hornets\n\nAfter suffering through a deluge of DNPs this campaign, Kaminsky has resurfaced during the past week. Over his past three games, Kaminsky has averaged 16.5 PPG, 7.0 REB and 1.5 3PG. He's also hit 7 of 13 3s over that same span. Last night, Kaminsky posted his best game of the season, going for 20 points and four 3-pointers in a low-scoring loss against the Heat. If you're looking for cheap scoring punch from the five ... Kaminsky has shot his way back into late-season consideration.\n\nCheick Diallo, PF, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe less Anthony Davis plays, the more Diallo produces (he's posted 7.49 Player Rater points over the past two weeks). Give Diallo 20-plus minutes, and he'll give you a double-double. Over back-to-back games last week against the Suns and Nuggets, Diallo averaged 21.5 MPG, 13.5 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 2.0 SPG and 0.5 BPG while shooting 72.2 percent from the field. As Davis' Pelicans career winds down, Diallo should get plenty of opportunities down the stretch.\n\nHarry Giles III, PF, Sacramento Kings\n\nEven after Marvin Bagley III returns, he's liable to see his minutes managed in order to protect his knee. Willie Cauley-Stein does not seem long for Sacramento. Giles is seizing his opportunity. Like Diallo, Giles doesn't need much more than 20 MPG to return 10-team league value. Over his past three games (going into last night's tilt against Boston), Giles averaged 18.7 MPG, 16.7 PPG, 6.3 RPG, while shooting 65.7 percent from the field.\n\nUnlike Diallo, Giles hasn't provided much in the way of steals and blocks (0.8 SPG+BPG for the season.) Still, Giles should prove a nice double-double threat over the last month of the regular season.\n\nJosh Okogie, SG, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nThe 20-year-old rookie's playing time has been amplified since Robert Covington's ankle became an issue. Since Jan. 2, Okogie has averaged 26.8 MPG, 8.6 PPG, 3.0, 1.0 3PG and 1.4 SPG. Playing time hasn't been Okogie's issue; it's been his inconsistent shooting. Over the same period (since Jan. 2), Okogie's only shot 37.0 percent from the field and 28.4 percent from deep. Still, there have been flashes when Okogie has put it all together. The defensive stats are already there.",

    "title": "How to keep your pets safe from hypothermia and frostbite, according to an Iditarod sled-dog veterinarian",
    "body": "Winter weather in the northeastern US can be dangerous for humans and our pets. Dogs and other domestic animals can get frostbite and hypothermia on their ears, tails, and noses. Some breeds, particularly those with short hair, are more vulnerable than others. In Alaska, dog mushers are currently tracing a historic path for the annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog race. Here's how they keep their sled dogs warm.\n\nIn a winter that has already brought a snow squall and polar vortex, Mother Nature has unleashed another wave of snow and cold across the US this week.\n\nFreezing temperatures come with an increased risk of frostbite - a condition in which a person's skin and underlying tissues freeze or, in extreme cases, die - as well as hypothermia.\n\nThe tips of our fingers, toes, ear lobes, cheeks, and nose are the most susceptible to frostbite, because the body prioritizes keeping your core and head warm at the cost of everything else. That means blood flow to extremities tends to be redirected when the body is exposed to extreme cold. Less blood flow puts the skin at greater risk of freezing.\n\nHypothermia occurs when our body loses heat faster than it can produce it. If untreated, hypothermia can lead to heart failure and even death.\n\nCold temperatures can affect our furry friends in similar ways. Dogs and other domestic animals are just as vulnerable to frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nHow to spot frostbite and hypothermia in a dog\n\nWhen Fido goes outside in the cold, the areas farthest from his heart - like the tail, ears, and nose - experience a drop in blood flow similar to the process in humans. This causes tissue damage.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Lekker makkelijk zo'n verspakket van Jumbo of Albert Heijn, maar is het goedkoper dan de ingredi\u00ebnten los kopen?\n\nSigns of frostbite on your animal could include pale gray or bluish skin, coldness or brittleness of an affected area, swelling, and blisters, according to Ernest Ward, a vet with the Veterinary Centers of America (VCA).\n\nIn fact, some of these signs can take a few days to appear, particularly if the affected area is small or non-weight bearing (like the ears or tip of the tail).\n\nWard suggested that if you suspect your dog has frostbite or hypothermia, it's best to seek medical attention immediately. In the meantime, he said, wrap your dog's body in warm dry towels or blankets and place hot water bottles wrapped in towels nearby.\n\nIt's important not to rub or massage the affected area, and not to use direct dry heat from a heating pad or hair dryer to warm your dog extremities, Ward says.\n\nIf dogs spend too much time exposed to extreme cold, their overall body temperatures can drop, which can be fatal. Hypothermic dogs can seem lethargic and stiff, and other signs of hypothermia include shivering, lack of coordination, and low heart rate.\n\nExperts caution against leaving any dog unattended outside for any period of time during extreme weather events like a polar vortex.\n\nRead More: How long you can stay outside in extreme cold before getting frostbite\n\nFoto: Jonny Mendoza and his dog Subi sled down a snowy hill in Kansas City, Kansas after a winter storm.sourceCharlie Riedel/AP\n\nYet a dog's breed can determine its susceptibility to frostbite, according to the American Kennel Club. Short-haired breeds like pugs and French bulldogs are more prone to it than Siberian and Alaskan huskies and malamutes (unsurprisingly).\n\nHuskies and other sled dogs are even known for competing in long races in bitter cold, like the historic 1,000-mile-long Iditarod race, which started on March 3 and is expected to finish next week.\n\nHere are some reasons why these canines are able to beat the deep freeze.\n\nHow to keep sled dogs warm in extreme cold\n\nAn animal's ability to tolerate cold weather depends on its age, diet, health, and coat density, according to Susan Whiton, a sled-dog veterinarian in Wasilla, Alaska. Whiton has competed in the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest race from the Yukon Territory to Fairbanks, Alaska, and her husband has raced in the Iditarod multiple times.\n\nHuskies and malamutes do well in such conditions because they have thick undercoats, she said in an interview with Cattledog Publishing.\n\n\"The thick undercoat of the Northern Breeds provides loft, like a fuzzy mohair sweater, and keeps the warmth next to the animal rather than allowing it to escape,\" Whiton said. These breeds also use their thick fur to keep warm while they sleep, curling up with their tail over their nose to trap extra heat against their bodies.\n\nFoto: A Siberian husky sled dog curled up in the snow at Birches on the Lake in Long Lake, Minnesota.sourceLorie Shaull/Flickr/Attribution License\n\n\"Cold is not a problem when the dogs are running during the race,\" Whiton said. \"Overheating is a bigger problem.\"\n\nOne surprising sign that dogs are not staying warm is the presence of ice on their fur, since that means they're losing enough body heat to melt the snow that's on top of them, Whiton said.\n\n\"There are lots of photos of resting sled dogs covered with snow,\" Whiton said. That is actually a good sign: \"They are holding their heat well since the snow is not melted.\"\n\nShe also noted that sled dogs often eat a very different diet than regular pets in order to stay warm.\n\n\"The calories in most commercial dog foods come from carbohydrates,\" she said. But in very cold weather, dogs do better with a higher amount of fat. One study suggested that a sled dog racing the Iditarod needs 10,000 calories a day to meet its metabolic needs.\n\n\"The only way to meet that high caloric need is with a diet high in fat calories,\" Whiton said. But she warned that most pet dogs don't need that many calories and could get very sick from a high-fat diet.\n\nWhiton added that fatty diets helped her dogs' resilience during the Yukon Quest, when her team encountered temperatures of minus 55 degrees Fahrenheit at night and minus 20 degrees during the day.\n\n\"It is hard for humans who think 30 degrees Fahrenheit is cold to imagine dogs doing well at minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit,\" Whiton said. \"But the dogs do amazingly well if they are acclimated, healthy, fed well, and housed well.\"\n\nHow to keep your dog safe in the cold - no matter where you live\n\nSometimes, Iditarod dogs need extra help to keep warm. If it's windy, sled dogs can wear nylon and fleece coats to protect the bare areas on their bellies, Whiton said.\n\nThe sled dogs also wear booties, but they aren't for preventing frostbite. Instead, they minimize abrasions and the chance of cuts on dogs' feet. Extreme cold makes the snow harsh like sandpaper, according to Whiton. The boots also keep balls of ice from collecting around the dogs' foot pads.\n\nFoto: Dog musher Tom Schonberger's team sprints at the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Anchorage, Alaska.sourceAssociated Press\n\nRecreational pet owners can use some of the same techniques to keep their animals safe and warm during winter walks. Urban pets can wear the same type of booties during expeditions into, say, New York's concrete jungle in order to keep their paws ice-free.\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Foundation (AVMF) recommends that owners of dogs with short coats (or of any dog that seems bothered by the cold) dress their pet in a warm sweater or coat. This extra layer needs to be dry, though, because wet sweaters can make your dog colder, and damp body parts are even more vulnerable to frostbite.\n\nUltimately, the AVMF said, consider your pet's individual needs during extreme winter weather. Short-legged dogs' bellies are more likely to come into contact with the icy ground, for example, and older pups may struggle to walk on snow and ice without slipping.\n\nWard cautioned that dogs with heart disease or diabetes - conditions associated with reduced blood flow to the extremities - are at greater risk for frostbite. The same goes for very young and very old dogs that can't regulate their body temperatures as efficiently.\n\nWhen in doubt, just shorten your dog's walks in extreme cold. It'll protect both of you from frostbite and hypothermia.",

    "title": "Oceans Are 'Spiking a Fever' With Record Heat Waves",
    "body": "This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe number of heat waves affecting the planet's oceans has increased sharply, scientists have revealed, killing swathes of sea life like \"wildfires that take out huge areas of forest.\" The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful for humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-warming carbon dioxide the atmosphere, they say.\n\nGlobal warming is gradually increasing the average temperature of the oceans, but the new research is the first systematic global analysis of ocean heat waves, when temperatures reach extremes for five days or more.\n\nThe research found heat waves are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, with the number of heat wave days tripling in the last couple of years studied. In the longer term, the number of heat wave days jumped by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with the period of 1925 to 1954.\n\nAs heat waves have increased, kelp forests, seagrass meadows and coral reefs have been lost. These foundation species are critical to life in the ocean. They provide shelter and food to many others, but have been hit on coasts from California to Australia to Spain.\n\n\"You have heat wave-induced wildfires that take out huge areas of forest, but this is happening underwater as well,\" said Dan Smale at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, UK, who led the research published in Nature Climate Change. \"You see the kelp and seagrasses dying in front of you. Within weeks or months they are just gone, along hundreds of kilometers of coastline.\"\n\nAs well as quantifying the increase in heat waves, the team analysed 116 research papers on eight well-studied marine heat waves, such as the record-breaking \"Ningaloo Nin\u0303o\" that hit Australia in 2011 and the hot \"blob\" that persisted in the north-east Pacific from 2013 to 2016. \"They have adverse impacts on a wide range of organisms, from plankton to invertebrates, to fish, mammals and seabirds,\" Smale said.\n\nThe scientists compared the areas where heat waves have increased most with those areas harboring rich biodiversity or species already near their temperature limit and those where additional stresses, such as pollution or overfishing, already occur. This revealed hotspots of harm from the northeast Atlantic to the Caribbean to the western Pacific. \"A lot of ocean systems are being battered by multiple stresses,\" Smale said.\n\nThe natural ocean cycle of El Nin\u0303o is a key factor in pushing up temperatures in some parts of the ocean and the effect of global warming on the phenomenon remains uncertain, but the gradual overall heating of the oceans means heat waves are worse when they strike.\n\n\"The starting temperature is much higher, so the absolute temperatures [in a heat wave] are that much higher and more stressful,\" said Smale. Some marine wildlife is mobile and could in theory swim to cooler waters, but ocean heat waves often strike large areas more rapidly than fish move, he said.\n\nThe researchers said ocean heat waves can have \"major socioeconomic and political ramifications\", such as in the northwest Atlantic in 2012, when lobster stocks were dramatically affected, creating tensions across the US-Canada border.\n\n\"This [research] makes clear that heat waves are hitting the ocean all over the world ... The ocean, in effect, is spiking a fever,\" said Prof Malin Pinsky, at Rutgers University, US, and not part of the team. \"These events are likely to become more extreme and more common in the future unless we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nDr \u00c9va Plag\u00e1nyi at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia also likened ocean heat waves to wildfires. \"Frequent big hits can have long-lasting effects,\" she said. \"This study shows that record-breaking events are becoming the new normal.\"\n\nThe damage global warming is causing to the oceans has also been shown in a series of other scientific papers published in the last week. Ocean warming has cut sustainable fish catches by 15% to 35% in five regions, including the North Sea and the East China Sea, and 4% globally, according to work published by Pinsky and colleagues.\n\n\"We were stunned to find that fisheries around the world have already responded to ocean warming,\" he said. Another study showed that achieving the 2C climate change target set out in the Paris agreement would protect almost 10 metric tons of fish catches each year, worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nSeparate work by Plag\u00e1nyi's team showed that climate change will reverse the recovery of whales in the Southern Ocean by damaging the krill on which they feed. \"Models predict concerning declines, and even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue and fin whales, and Atlantic and Indian Ocean fin and humpback whales,\" they said.\n\n\"In the space of one week, scientific publications have underscored that unless we take evasive action, our future oceans will have fewer fish, fewer whales and frequent dramatic shifts in ecological structure will occur, with concerning implications for humans who depend on the ocean,\" said Plag\u00e1nyi.",

    "title": "What keeps Adam Silver up at night",
    "body": "THE CONVERSATION NBA COMMISSIONER Adam Silver had with Bill Simmons last week in Boston was perhaps the most candid and personal of his tenure. It was a refreshing departure from standard public sessions, which are often filled with rose-colored and obfuscation-filled comments.\n\nOne month from his five-year anniversary in the job, Silver admitted that the NBA has some real challenges. He said the league has made some mistakes that have caused him to lose sleep. He hinted that he's even re-evaluating what he wants his identity as commissioner to be.\n\nThere's no crisis, per se. Anyone who runs an $8 billion worldwide operation is always going to be managing a full plate of problems. He was letting us into his world in a way I've never seen before, sharing his real thoughts and fears -- or so it seems. And in a way, that showed both vulnerability and curiosity. It was wonderful.\n\nHere are a few things he said and explained:\n\nHere are two larger points that merit discussion:\n\nThere are some real issues here. In addition to TV ratings, a midseason report that was recently distributed to teams showed that tickets sales are slightly down this season, according to sources. Overall ticket revenue is slightly up, but matched with the ratings trend, Silver has reason to be unsettled.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors make $3.4 million in gate revenue per game, best in the league. That's not a surprise, as it's a big market, and they're the best team. But the New York Knicks, the league's worst team, pull in an average of $2.9 million per game at the gate, sources said. Compared to the bottom of the list -- the Memphis Grizzlies get less than $1 million per night -- it shows the disparity.\n\nThis issue has been around as long as the league has. It's why the Warriors and Knicks pay into a pool of money that gets transferred to low-revenue teams such as the Grizzlies. But as Silver says, the Grizzlies would always have a great challenge to truly compete even if they were able to land two or three superstars. If the Knicks got two superstars -- and they're trying -- they'd be awash in cash like the Warriors.\n\nThat Silver is willing to discuss these topics is to be applauded. Since he became commissioner -- Silver recently got a big raise and a six-year contract extension -- he has focused a lot on revenue-generation.\n\nHe has negotiated a $24 billion TV rights deal, gotten a new, low-stress CBA done, brought in jersey ads and led the charge for legalizing sports betting while lobbying states to cut the league in on the deal.\n\nThere also have been player relations and transparency moves. He created last two-minute reports to make referee performance partially public. He has extended the All-Star break and regular season to build in extra rest and, at the request of LeBron James, made a rule that the team that wins the title gets to stay home for Christmas.\n\nThis version of Silver seemed so much different than the one who often answered questions pleasantly but somewhat dismissively -- \"We'll take a fresh look at it\" -- over the years. There was real meat here, and those who were at the panel or watched it got a better understanding of the health of the sport.\n\nSilver seemed to start going down this path with comments during All-Star Weekend, when he admitted that some \"unintended consequences\" had led to star trade demands.\n\nHere's hoping this continues. He seems to be spending a lot of his day worrying about how to get into the minds of millennials, be they players or fans. Being honest is a good way to start.\n\nSEVERAL STREAKS MIGHT BE ENDING for LeBron James this season. His historic run of eight straight Finals and his streak of 13 straight playoff appearances look to be at an end. Another one might be in trouble: his 11-season streak of making first-team All-NBA, which is tied with Karl Malone for the longest in league history.\n\nThe competition for forward spots this season will be intense on the first team, specifically with MVP candidates Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George as strong contenders. Kevin Durant, who has made the first team six times, including last season, also figures to get votes.\n\nAfter missing a career-high 18 games because of a groin injury and with the Lakers underwhelming, James, who was unanimously voted to All-NBA first team last season, might well slip. Kawhi Leonard, another contender for a spot, has missed 19 games because of injury or rest.\n\nIf James makes one of the three teams this season, it will tie the record for career All-NBA selections, at 15. Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan share that record. James has been a first-team selection 12 times and a second-team pick twice. The only time he didn't make the team was his rookie season in 2003-04.\n\nMIAMI HEAT PRESIDENT PAT RILEY has given a couple interviews over the past week indicating that he is pursuing a strategy of clearing two max salary slots in the summer of 2020. The Heat have cap space coming already in '20 -- currently, they're in position to have more than $40 million, enough to sign one max player -- but Riley made it sound as if he's ready to dump some more salary to take a major swing.\n\n\"Clearing space is easy. You just watched the Knicks do it, and what was their price in doing it? You watched the Clippers do it, and what was their price in doing it?\" Riley told reporters in Miami last weekend. \"We have the two picks [first-round selections in 2019 and 2020]. We have a lot of assets. We have cash. We have exceptions. We will improve the team. It will be much better than it is now.\"\n\nThe Knicks traded Kristaps Porzingis to clear cap space, and the Clippers traded Tobias Harris because they weren't sure they'd re-sign him in the summer. The Heat don't appear to have such a player whom they could use to dump salary and get picks and young players like the Knicks and Clippers did. However, they do have some attractive prospects, including Josh Richardson and Bam Adebayo.\n\nThe challenging contracts to move to get the Heat toward the two max slots would probably be Dion Waiters and James Johnson, who are scheduled to make $29 million between them in 2020-21.\n\nThe 2020 free-agent class isn't as deep in stars as this summer's group. But that year Anthony Davis is scheduled to be a free agent. There's also the possibility that some of the big names this summer could consider taking short-term contracts that would have them back in the market a year later. If the Heat have cap space, they also become a spot where star players could force a trade.\n\nMiami missed out on the past few major free agents it went for, namely Kevin Durant and Gordon Hayward. But the Heat, in the midst of a few middling seasons and stuck in salary-cap jail, could be classified as a sleeping giant. Riley's plan to sign role players and combine them with guys developing in-house hasn't worked out. Now, he wants back in on the star hunt.",

    "body": "MELBOURNE, March 7 (Reuters) - Darren Lehmann is returning to Big Bash side Brisbane Heat in his first coaching role since resigning as Australia boss in the wake of the Cape Town ball-tampering scandal.\n\nLehmann returns to the Heat for a second stint as head coach, having previously led them to the 2012/13 title in the second edition of the domestic Twenty20 tournament.\n\n\"It was a wonderful experience at the time to be involved with building the Brisbane Heat at the start of the BBL, and we had plenty of fun along the way,\" the 49-year-old former test batsman said.\n\n\"I am looking forward to getting to work and helping the Heat play some outstanding cricket, have some fun, and provide our fans with a great experience.\"\n\nLehmann, who replaces the outgoing Daniel Vettori, will start the role next week.\n\nNicknamed 'Boof', Lehmann was contracted as head coach of Australia through to this year's Ashes series but resigned in tears last March after Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were banned for the 'sandpaper-gate' scandal.\n\nHe was cleared of wrongdoing by governing body Cricket Australia but carried much of the blame in the eyes of local media for failing to rein in player misconduct.\n\n\"It was a tough time for everyone involved, none more so than the three players,\" Lehmann, who guided Australia to two Ashes victories and the 2015 World Cup win on home soil, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"So for me it's a case of really enjoying the game again. I went away and watched the game all summer, which was absolutely fantastic.\"\n\nHe added that he had no ambitions of coaching at the national level again.\n\n\"No, I'm not travelling 300 days away again a year and I don't think my wife would let me either,\" he said.\n\nThe Heat finished fifth in the 2018/19 tournament won by Melbourne Renegades.

    "body": "Kelly Olynyk scored 22 points and Hassan Whiteside came off the bench for 18 points and 15 rebounds as the visiting Miami Heat emerged from a playoff atmosphere with a 91-84 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Heat went on a 14-0 run early in the fourth quarter to lead by 16, and later pushed the lead up to 17 before the Hornets got as close as four in the final minute. Olynyk keyed the 14-0 run with a 3-pointer and a steal and dunk, as the Heat pushed a 69-67 lead up to 83-67.\n\nThe teams entered the game with identical 29-34 records, so the win allowed the Heat to take sole possession of eighth place in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Heat have now won three straight and four of their last five. It was also Miami's first win over the Hornets in three tries this season.\n\nBoth teams played zone defenses much of the game and both offenses struggled. The Heat shot 41.8 percent from the field and committed 18 turnovers, and the Hornets shot 36.6 percent and committed 19 turnovers.\n\nThe Heat also got 13 points from Josh Richardson and 10 from Bam Adebayo. Dwyane Wade, in his final game at the Spectrum Center, scored eight on 4-of-15 shooting from the field. Six of Wade's points came at crucial times in the fourth quarter.\n\nKemba Walker and Frank Kaminsky led the Hornets with 20 points apiece, although Walker was just 5 of 17 from the field.\n\nThe Heat took control quickly and led 25-12 late in the first quarter, eventually leading 29-18 after one. But they got sloppy and went cold in the second quarter, scoring only 14 second-quarter points, and the game was tied 43-43 at halftime. The Hornets then led by as many as five in the third quarter before the Heat fought back and led 61-58 after three quarters.\n\nThe Heat will return home to start a five-game home stand on Friday against Cleveland. The Hornets will remain home on Friday night against Washington.\n\nThe Heat and Hornets will meet one more time this season, on March 17 in Miami.",

    "title": "Rescuers use heat-seeking drones after tornado",
    "body": "Rescue crews didn't have to stumble through every destroyed building in their search for victims after a tornado ravaged a corner of Alabama this week: They used heat-seeking drones to let them know whether there was anyone beneath the ruins.\n\nIn so doing, they joined the increasing ranks of public safety agencies across the U.S. and around the world that have employed unmanned thermal-imaging aircraft during critical situations, including manhunts, wildfires and other natural disasters.\n\nIn tornado-stricken Alabama, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said Tuesday it was not clear if drones spotted any bodies or anyone injured or trapped in the debris. But at the least, they helped reassure searchers that they hadn't overlooked anyone in the aftermath of the twister that killed 23 people.\n\nREAD MORE: Is climate change making U.S. tornadoes worse?\n\n\"They gave us an overhead view of areas we might have missed had we been at eye level on land,\" Jones said.\n\nThermal-imaging drones use infrared cameras that find heat sources on the ground, in buildings or in water, at any time of day, whether from a human or animal, alive or newly deceased, or from other things, such as flames.\n\nThe devices can transmit a color-coded image in real time to a laptop, cellphone, tablet or large-screen monitor. Depending on the settings the user chooses, heat sources can be made to stand out in bright red, white or other colors.\n\nLaw enforcement officers and firefighters who use such airborne technology swear by it as a tool to protect and save lives. Drones are cheaper than manned aircraft such as helicopters, which can't get into tight spaces and require more training.\n\nOfficials in China, Nepal and Mexico used drones -- with and without heat-detecting equipment -- after devastating earthquakes. Firefighters battling fast-moving blazes in California's woods employed heat-seeking drones to map fires and search burned homes. They also have been used to locate missing people, as in the case of an 11-year-old girl found last year in the thick woods of North Carolina.\n\nIn Hamilton County, Tennessee, Sheriff's Detective Marty Dunn got an urgent call last summer. A man involved in a domestic dispute had fled his home and ventured into the swampy woods near Chattanooga, perhaps with the intention of harming himself.\n\nDunn rushed to the scene with a thermal-imaging drone. He guided the aircraft over the thick canopy of trees and found what he had been looking for in about 6 minutes -- a heat signature that told him a human was sitting at the base of a tree. The man was rescued quickly and safely, Dunn said.\n\nIt took less time than a search by deputies and police dogs would have, he said.\n\n\"It's an amazing tool,\" Dunn said. \"It worked out for the best.\"\n\nIn the San Francisco area, the Menlo Park Fire Protection District boasts a fleet of about 15 drones with varying capabilities, some with regular cameras, some with thermal-imaging ones. During last year's devastating wildfires in Northern California, thermal-imaging drones mapped areas where fires raged. The pictures were sent to firefighters' cellphones, helping them attack the flames efficiently, Chief Harold Schapelhouman said.\n\nWATCH: After deadly tornado, survivors face freezing temperatures amid power outages\n\nMenlo Park firefighters also used thermal drones to find people lost in San Francisco Bay, and took drones to Texas to help after Hurricane Harvey. There, the aircraft scoped out flooded areas to make rescue-boat navigation easier amid fallen trees, power lines and other obstacles, Schapelhouman said.\n\n\"It's a super-efficient piece of equipment,\" said Schapelhouman, who estimates the department has spent $200,000 in its drone program, including pilot training.\n\nIn Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd has a team of 20 drone pilots on his Aerial Response Team. Polk County uses its thermal-imaging drones at night, finding burglars who thought they were safe hiding in the dark.\n\nDrone operations in Florida are limited by strict laws. Judd said the sheriff's office can use drones only in an emergency, such as a tornado or hurricane, or with a court order.\n\n\"We can't put it in the air just to look at traffic flows or to write traffic citations or anything like that,\" Judd said. \"You can't launch them to do even population surveillance at a football game to see where you're having trouble.\"\n\nA Portland, Oregon-based company, FLIR Systems, designs, makes and sells thermal-imaging cameras used by police and fire departments. It has been working on airborne thermal-imaging technology for about 40 years and jumped into the drone camera business for public safety agencies about four years ago, said Jeff Frank, senior vice president for global product strategy.\n\nCamera-and-drone combinations can range from about $1,500 to around $10,000, Frank said.\n\nIn a study issued last May, the Center for the Study of Drones at Bard College reported at least 910 state and local police, sheriff, fire and emergency-service agencies in the U.S. have acquired drones.\n\nThe report's author, Dan Gettinger, said it is not clear how many agencies have drones with thermal-imaging capabilities but estimated it is less than 25 percent and increasing.",

That prompted chants of \"Let's Go Heat!\" from the crowd -- many of those Heat fans wearing No. 3 jerseys who'd come to see Dwyane Wade's final NBA game in Charlotte.\n\nWade had a rough night shooting, going 4 of 15 from the field and missed both free-throw attempts. He finished with eight points and six assists. After the game, Charlotte's Kemba Walker exchanged jerseys with Wade at midcourt.\n\nThe win was crucial for the Heat's playoff chances given the Hornets had won the previous two games this season. The teams meet again March 17 in Miami.\n\nCharlotte Hornets' Kemba Walker (15) tries to shoot over Miami Heat's Bam Adebayo (13) during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday, March 6, 2019.

Charlotte shot 36.6 percent; Miami 41.8 percent.\n\nTIP INS\n\nHeat: Had 13 turnovers in the first half, including nine in the second quarter -- the most they've had in any quarter this season. Derrick Jones Jr. had four turnovers during a four-minute stretch in the first half and Bam Adebayo had four in the first half as well.\n\nHornets: Tight end Greg Olsen of the Carolina Panthers was sitting courtside for Wade's final game in Charlotte. ...

    "body": "HYDERABAD: The heat wave condition that sweeps across the city and the state almost every summer is a manifestation of an extreme weather event. At a workshop on extreme weather events held at the centre for economic and social studies (CESS) on Wednesday, researchers spoke on this.\n\n\"Heat waves are silent killers. Until a person is in his last stage, he might not realise that he has had a sun stroke which is extremely dangerous. Our aim is to take precautionary measures and take this awareness campaign to the last person so that we are able to reduce human and property loses to a great extent,\" said Y K Reddy, director, Indian meteorological department (IMD-Hyderabad), at the workshop.\n\nHe further informed that though number of heat wave deaths reduced substantially in 2018, about 12 people still died. Reddy also indicated the probability of above-normal summer temperatures this year in the state. In the worst-affected parts of Telangana, maximum temperatures will hover around a searing 45 Celsius and may even touch 47, especially in the northern parts. About 15 to 20 heat wave days are expected this summer, IMD officials added.\n\nExperts at Unicef, the state disaster management and IMD, however, assured that precautions will be taken to make sure that not even one person will die of heat wave in the state this year.\n\n\"It is possible to deal with the heat wave which is a silent killer if we have to do so. We need to have a long-term view of what Telanagana is going to give to the country to adopt from their action plan. We will work together to also curb the impact of heat wave on children,\" said Sony Kutty George, Unicef representative on child protection.\"We will make sure that not a single person will die of heat wave this year,\" he further added.\n\nThe workshop, organised jointly by the state development planning society (TSDPS), IMD-Hyderabad, Indian meteorological society (IMS), Unicef, state disaster response and the fire services department, was a continuation of the efforts for preparing an action plan to face adverse heat wave conditions expected to occur during the peak summer months.\n\nIn his inaugural address at the workshop, Rajeshwar Tiwari, principal secretary (revenue) and principal commissioner for disaster management said that the heat wave action plan provides an insight into heat-related illness and response actions to be undertaken.",

    "title": "Hot, Hard, And Awkward To Repair, Here Are Samsung's Galaxy S10 Secrets",
    "body": "Samsung's Galaxy S10 family certainly pushes what can be packed into a premium consumer smartphone, but the team at iFixit wanted to find out how everything was crammed in. And that tells us a lot about Samsung's philosophy and how cutting edge the S10 actually is.\n\nCracking open the new handset in one of its customary teardowns, iFixit's engineers found that the internal design is largely iterative, following previous trends. This is not a device that is going to be easily repaired, and one that may put a heavy strain on the battery.\n\nFirst up, the motherboard has the USB-C port mounted directly on to it. That's going to place strain on the port and the circuitry. That makes damage more likely and a repair much more awkward.\n\nBut this isn't the main cause for concern over repair costs. The Galaxy S10 introduces an ultrasonic fingerprint reader into the display of the flagship smartphone. And it is \"fused to the display. Damage to one component will require both to be replaced, pushing up the cost and environmental impact.\n\nThen there's the heat. Samsung has outfitted the S10 not only with the ability to be charged wirelessly, but to charge other devices wirelessly. This is going to be something to watch carefully over the long-term, because acting as a charging plate generates a lot more heat than receiving power through inductive charging. Samsung has placed the charging coils between graphite to help heat dissipation, and added graphite pads to lift the back cover away from this heat source.\n\nThe internal heat pipe has also been increased. Samsung is expecting a lot of heat to be generated in the S10, and with wired fast charging circuitry alongside the wireless charging coils, that's a sensible precaution. But heat also has a habit of killing batteries in the medium- to long-term. It will be interesting to see just how much of an impact this has on battery capacity and power delivery in twelve months time\n\nOh and the battery is glued in place, just to make its replacement even harder.\n\nI find it hard to disagree with the team's sentiments:\n\nIt's a shame to see so much innovation go into hardware that, in the end, is still treated as disposable. Someday a more radical redesign may grace our teardown table, but for now we'd settle for some pull tabs on these short-lived batteries.\n\nThere's no doubt that the Samsung's Galaxy S10 family are at the cutting edge of what can be delivered in terms of hardware. But it's also clear that Samsung - in chasing the fashion of slim smartphones looking to achieve an 'all screen' forward aspect has continued the philosophy of making the smartphone 'disposable' to the average consumer.",

    "body": "Darren Lehmann has fallen back in love with cricket, but says he will never consider another international coaching stint after returning to where it all began in Brisbane.\n\nFormer Australian coach Lehmann will get back in the saddle for the Heat, where he launched a career that shuddered to a halt following last year's ball-tampering scandal, in his first coaching role since resigning in the wake of events in Cape Town.\n\nKeen to move on from the episode, Lehmann said he had rediscovered his love for the sport and hoped his two-year Big Bash League deal was an endorsement of his methods.\n\nLehmann ultimately resigned over the incident after players David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft were also suspended but he continued to work developing talent with the national performance squad and other cricket pathway programs before entering the media.\n\nNews Corp reported Lehmann edged Queensland Bulls coach Wade Seccombe for the role, with former Heat batsman Brendon McCullum and international all-rounder James Hopes also applying. Brisbane-based Lehmann had previously coached the Heat to their only title.\n\n\"It was a wonderful experience at the time to be involved with building the Brisbane Heat at the start of the BBL, and we had plenty of fun along the way,\" said Lehmann.\n\n\"I enjoyed watching the BBL, and the Heat, during the season and as a coach, I am pretty excited to be working with the Heat players, who I know are as talented and determined as anyone going around.\n\n\"I am looking forward to getting to work and helping the Heat play some outstanding cricket, have some fun, and provide our fans with a great experience.\"\n\nBrisbane Heat general manager Andrew McShea said he was glad to have Lehmann onboard, and he would resume his position next week. Lehmann, who earned 27 Test caps as a player, said he was chuffed to return.\n\n\"It was a wonderful experience at the time to be involved with building the Brisbane Heat at the start of the BBL and we had plenty of fun,\" he said.\n\n\"I enjoyed watching the BBL and the Heat during the season and, as a coach, I am pretty excited to be working with the Heat players, who I know are as talented and determined as anyone going around.\"",

    "body": "Don't miss out on backing Detroit, who will look to keep its late-season surge going against Minnesota on Wednesday night\n\nWelcome back to CBS Sports' NBA betting notebook. Each week we'll take a look at a few trends going on throughout the league from a betting perspective, as well as examine the game of the week.\n\nThis week, we'll take a look at one of the league's hottest teams, the Detroit Pistons. With eight wins in their last 10 games, they've surged back into the playoff picture. Can they not only win, but keep up their strong form against the spread as well? Speaking of the Eastern Conference playoff race, two other teams in the thick of it square off on Wednesday night when the Heat visit the Hornets. But while the result of this game is important, we'll focus on the point total.\n\nLast week's record: 2-1. Season record: 4-4\n\nTrending up: Timberwolves at Pistons\n\nTrend to know: Pistons are 4-1 against the spread in their last five games, and 5-0 ATS in their last five home games\n\nDate: Wednesday, Mar. 6\n\nTime: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Little Caesars Arena -- Detroit, Michigan\n\nStreaming: fuboTV (free trial - NBA League Pass add-on available)\n\nLive stats: GameTrackerOdds: Pistons -5.5\n\nOnce dismissed as yet another disappointing team in an Eastern Conference full of them, the Detroit Pistons have turned their season around in recent weeks. They've won nine of their last 11 games to get back to .500 on the season and climb into the playoff picture. Entering Wednesday, they're tied with the Brooklyn Nets for sixth place in the East.\n\nAnd as they've surged up the standings by winning games left and right, they've also done well against the spread. They're 4-1 ATS in their last five games overall, and 5-0 in their last five home games. And home is where they'll be on Wednesday night when they take on the Minnesota Timberwolves, who are on the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nLike many teams, the Pistons are much better at home, where they haven't lost since early February. And they're facing a Timberwolves team that has been a disaster on the road, going just 9-24 on their travels this season.\n\nZooming in even closer to more recent trends, the big reason for the Pistons' turnaround has been their improved offensive play. For much of the season they've struggled offensively. Yet in their last five games, they boast the third-best offensive rating in the league at 117.2 points per 100 possessions. A big reason for that is their outstanding 3-point shooting, as they're knocking down over 43 percent of their attempts from deep in that stretch. The good news for them is it should continue against a Wolves team that has been disgraceful on the defensive end lately, giving up 115.7 points per 100 possessions in their last five games.\n\nThe Pistons are at home, playing their best basketball of the season and have plenty of motivation with the playoffs on the line. They should be able to cover against the Wolves, who have been terrible on the road this season and face the added challenge of playing on consecutive nights.\n\nBet: Pistons -5.5\n\nSo which Wednesday NBA picks should you back for a huge 6-1 payout? And which underdog is a must-back? Visit SportsLine to get the best bets for Wednesday's NBA schedule, all from the NBA expert hitting on an astonishing 67 percent of his NBA picks.\n\nOver/Under: Heat at Hornets\n\nTrend to know: The total has gone over in five of the Heat's last six games, and over in six of the Hornets' last seven games\n\nDate: Wednesday, Mar. 6\n\nTime: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Spectrum Center -- Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nStreaming: fuboTV (free trial - NBA League Pass add-on available)\n\nLive stats: GameTrackerOdds: Over/Under 215.5\n\nAs the playoff race in the Western Conference turns rather anticlimactic in the final month-plus of the season, it's the Eastern Conference race that's heating up. There are currently five teams fighting for the last three spots, and they're all within three games of each other. Two of them will meet on Wednesday night in Charlotte, as the Hornets host the Miami Heat.\n\nWith identical 29-34 records, the two teams are currently tied for the eighth and final spot, and this game in particular is extremely important. A win for the Hornets would not only put them a game ahead of the Heat, but would clinch the season tiebreaker, which could very well prove the difference between making the playoffs or not.\n\nBut while it's clear the game is important from a standings perspective, what about from a gambling one? For this contest, we'll focus on the point total rather than the spread. As we head down the stretch, it's important to look even more closely at recent trends rather than full season ones, and this matchup features two teams heading in similar directions.\n\nOver the last five games, the Heat and Hornets have both played well on the offensive end, while pretty much completely ignoring the other side of the court. During that stretch, the Heat have the best offensive rating in the league at 119.4 points per 100 possessions, thanks in large part to the boost of shooting and floor spacing they've gotten from Kelly Olynyk. As for the Hornets, they're offensive rating of 112.2 is just outside the top 10, and a slight bump from their full-season numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hornets are 28th in the league in defensive rating over the last five games, allowing 115.8 points per 100 possessions, while the Heat aren't faring much better. Miami checks in at 23rd in the league, with a defensive rating of 114.9.\n\nWith both the Heat and Hornets trending up on offense and down on defense, and a fairly low -- for this season, at least -- point total, these two sides should have little trouble going over.\n\nBet: Over 215.5\n\nSo what are the optimal NBA DFS tournament lineups for tonight?

    "title": "Heat vs. Hornets odds, line: NBA picks, predictions from model on 52-37 roll",
    "body": "SportsLine's proven computer model simulated Wednesday's Hornets vs. Heat game 10,000 times\n\nKemba Walker and the Charlotte Hornets play host to Josh Richardson and the Miami Heat on Wednesday, with tipoff from Spectrum Center set for 7 p.m. ET. This is a pivotal game for both teams, as they enter the action tied for eighth in the Eastern Conference. Miami has won three of its past four, a stretch that includes a win over the Warriors. Charlotte, on the other hand, has sputtered lately, winning just one of its past five games. The Hornets are 3.5-point home favorites, while the over-under for total points is 215.5 in the latest Heat vs Hornets odds. Before you make any Heat vs. Hornets picks and NBA predictions, you'll want to see what SportsLine's advanced computer model has to say.\n\nThis model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, is crushing its NBA picks. It entered Week 21 of the 2018-19 NBA season with a sterling 234-178 record on all top-rated picks, returning more than $4,000 to anybody following them. And it has been particularly red-hot on its A-rated NBA picks against the spread, entering Week 21 on a strong 52-37 run. Anybody who has followed it is way up.\n\nNow it has locked in on Heat vs. Hornets. We can tell you it's leaning under, and it also says one side of the spread hits in over 60 percent of simulations. You can only see that strong selection at SportsLine.\n\nThe model is well aware of how important home-court advantage is in this matchup. While the Hornets have been one of the NBA's worst road teams, they have been tough to beat at home. Their 20-13 home record is one of the best marks in the East, and one of those wins was a double-digit victory over the Heat.\n\nIn addition, Hornets have already beaten Miami twice this season. Kemba Walker was terrific in those games, averaging 29 points and 7.5 assists, while shooting a scorching 48 percent on 3-pointers. Charlotte's All-Star point guard is averaging 27 points and seven assists in his past five games.\n\nBut just because Charlotte benefits from home court advantage doesn't mean it will cover the Hornets vs. Heat spread.\n\nThe model is also well aware that Miami has been one of Vegas' most underappreciated teams this season, especially on the road. The Heat have a top-10 cover rate (52.4 percent), which is all the way up to a league-best 64.5 percent on the road. The Heat are the only team in the NBA to have a better outright record on the road than at home.\n\nMiami has been receiving excellent contributions from a variety of players lately, as Dwyane Wade, Justise Winslow and Bam Adebayo are averaging above their season marks in points, rebounds and assists since the All-Star break. It has been a team effort, which has led to Miami covering the spread in each of its past three road games -- a stretch that includes opponents like the Rockets and Sixers.\n\nSo who wins Heat vs. Hornets? And which side of the spread can you bank on in over 60 percent of simulations? Visit SportsLine now to find out which side of the Heat vs. Hornets spread you need to jump on, all from the model that has crushed its NBA picks, and find out.",

    "title": "'Whole thing is unraveling': climate change reshaping Australia's forests",
    "body": "Australia's forests are being reshaped by climate change as droughts, heat waves, rising temperatures and bushfires drive ecosystems towards collapse, ecologists have told Guardian Australia. Trees are dying, canopies are getting thinner and the rate that plants produce seeds is falling. Ecologists have long predicted that climate change would have major consequences for Australia's forests.Now they believe those impacts are unfolding.\n\n\"The whole thing is unraveling,\" says Prof David Bowman, who studies the impacts of climate change and fire on trees at the University of Tasmania. \"Most people have no idea that it's even happening. The system is trying to tell you that if you don't pay attention then the whole thing will implode. We have to get a grip on climate change.\"\n\nAccording to the 2018 State of the Climate Report, produced by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, large parts of the country are experiencing increases in weather patterns favourable to fires. The report found that rainfall has dropped in the south-east and south-west of the country, temperatures have warmed by an average of 1C, and a \"shift to a warmer climate in Australia is accompanied by more extreme daily heat events\".\n\nDr Joe Fontaine, an ecologist at Murdoch University, says forests across Australia are changing. \"Impacts are direct - trees dying from heat and drought - as well as indirect - more fire, fewer seeds and a raft of associated feedbacks.\"\n\nFontaine says leaves are the \"machinery that makes the plant work\" and how those leaves cope with heat depends on moisture reserves. \"The question then is, how much do you have in reserve? A lot of us are really concerned about that.\"\n\nFontaine has studied one large shrub species - the south-western native Hooker's banksia - and found seed production has \"halved in the last 30 years\", which was \"definitely a climate-driven problem with increased drought\".\n\nLast spring, Fontaine and colleagues inspected an area 300km north of Perth where the banksias had been hit by fire several years earlier. He wanted to know if they could cope with fire on top of the area's long-term reduction in rainfall.\n\n\"At this stage, years after fire, those plants should be recovering and really going for it,\" he says. \"Except instead these banksias weredead and falling over left and right. The young plants were dying too - this area was losing all their young vigorous plants. With more bushfire, this species is at real risk of being wiped off the map.\"\n\nThe interval squeeze\n\nA study of the impacts of a heat wave in 2010 and 2011 in the south-west that followed long-term drops in rainfall found that the the large jarrah eucalypts and the area's giant banksias were severely affected. A knock-on effect, another study found, was that the area became even more prone to fires.\n\nBowman says the impacts of the changing climate are \"absolutely\" happening. Bowman and colleagues have found that big eucalypts grow slower as temperatures rise and alpine ash forests were at risk of being wiped out because fires were coming along too often.\n\nThis is part of a phenomenon known as the \"interval squeeze\" where species that are adapted to cope with drought or fire, struggle when the time between impacts gets shorter.\n\nBowman says the idea that Australia's forests are well adapted to the country's variable climate and can withstand fire and drought, was incorrect. \"A big misapprehension is that these things are climatologically flexible, but they're just not,\" he says, explaining that Australia's dominant eucalypts have \"fine-tuned their life history around assumptions of fire frequency\", but \"climate change is just blowing that up\".\n\n\"All this is non-linear,\" he says. \"What will happen is the system will crash faster than we realise. Yes, it will reassemble and there will be forests, but they won't look anything like what we have now. We are going to see this transformation before our eyes.\"\n\nPredicting the future?\n\nThe climate change impacts are not only restricted to old-growth forests - the changing climate is also causing problems for groups trying to reforest areas that have been previously cleared.\n\nUsually, revegetation projects will gather seeds from the local area to sow or propagate in a practice known as provenance planting.\n\nBut two major groups are using climate projection tools to second-guess the changes in rainfall and heat expected in the areas where they are planting.\n\nLandcare Australia and Bush Heritage Australia have started to source seeds from places that better match the climate conditions in coming decades.\n\nDr Matt Appleby, a senior ecologist at Bush Heritage Australia, says that in about 2014, the group began to see dead patches in a replanting project at Nardoo Hills in Victoria, and the problem worsened each year.\n\n\"We had a heat wave back in 2014 with about a week of temperatures well over 40C and that was combined with already low soil moisture,\" he says. \"We think that combination meant the trees were under so much stress they reach a critical point and were dying.\"\n\nNow the group has started a climate-ready revegetation project for the reserve. Even among the same species of tree, there can be subtle genetic variations that give the same species different tolerances depending on where they are growing.\n\nThe group has used climate tools to find areas in the country known as \"climate analogues\" that match the hotter and drier conditions expected at Nardoo.\n\n\"We are collecting seeds from those locations and bringing them to Nardoo Hills to propagate and plant out,\" Appleby says. What happens then is that in 20 years the seeds of those plants will be better adapted to the area - they should have that little bit more resilience.\"\n\nAppleby is concerned the job of gathering seeds for rarer species could get more difficult. \"Trying to get seed this past year has been incredibly difficult. What happens if in five years' time we get a run of 49C days?\" he says.\n\n\"How are we going to get seed then if everything is under pressure? People need to start thinking about seed banks and seed production areas so there's enough seed down the track to sustain this.\"\n\nDr Shane Norrish, the chief executive of Landcare Australia, says like many other organisations carrying out major revegetation works, climate change was presenting a challenge. For one major revegetation project at Dakalanta on the Eyre Peninsular, Landcare Australia has also used this \"climate-ready\" approach when sourcing some of their seeds.\n\n\"What you will never be able to deal with is the run of extreme hot days that we've experienced in southern Australia - that level of extreme variability challenges everyone.\"",

    "title": "Analysis | The Energy 202: Why ex-military leaders are trying to stop Trump's panel to counter climate science",
    "body": "Donald Trump at a 2018 rally in Charleston, W.Va. (Reuters/Leah Millis)\n\nFifty-eight former high-ranking military and intelligence officials issued a stern warning to the White House: Think twice about creating a panel to counter the government's own findings that climate change poses a threat to national security.\n\n\"Imposing a political test on reports issued by the science agencies, and forcing a blind spot onto the national security assessments that depend on them, will erode our national security,\" wrote a group of former generals, admirals and other national security officials in a letter Tuesday to President Trump, which I reported on here. \"It is dangerous to have national security analysis conform to politics.\"\n\nThey are objecting to plans by top administration officials to convene an ad hoc group of select federal scientists to scrutinize and potentially dispute the conclusions of recent federal climate reports, which The Post's Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Brady Dennis revealed last week.\n\nOfficials are still determining what sort of group they will assemble to assess the government's scientific findings and whether they will eventually establish an independent federal advisory committee to scrutinize climate science.\n\nYet the letter writers, who include heavyweights from President Barack Obama's administration such as former secretary of state John F. Kerry and former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, already worry the panel will end up unduly \"second-guessing the scientific sources\" that underpin the grave conclusions from most military leaders that climate change is a menace to the nation's security. They do not want the White House to, as they say, \"dispute and undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threat posed by climate change.\"\n\nThe question is whether there is any chance that Trump -- a commander in chief who likes to boast about \"my generals\" and \"my military\" -- will listen to these former military leaders.\n\n\"This letter is not an attack on the president, it is an offer of dialogue,\" said Andrew Holland, chief operating officer of the American Security Project. His group, along with the Center for Climate and Security, another policy and research nonprofit organization focused on security issues, organized the letter.\n\nIn various military and intelligence reports, military leaders predict that the impact of climate change will directly endanger U.S. facilities -- for example, a rise in sea level is expected to increase the risk of flooding at some naval bases. They also project that climate change will exacerbate conditions, such as drought, that lead to conflict.\n\nBut for years, Trump himself has had his mind made up: Climate change is \"madness,\" a \"con,\" a \"hoax.\" His administration has worked hard to unravel efforts under the previous president to curb climate-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants, natural gas wells and automobiles.\n\nStill, Holland said \"we do hold out hope\" of convincing Trump.\n\n\"We actively hope that he will listen to people like his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner,\" he said.\n\nThe couple, who both serve as senior White House advisers, each urged the president to keep the United States in the Paris climate accord, an international deal meant to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. But the president said early in his term the country would pull out of the widely hailed agreement.\n\nKerry helped broker that agreement for Obama. He, in particular, has made the urgency to curb global warming a focal point of his post-government career. In a recent Post op-ed denouncing Trump's climate panel, Kerry called the administration's efforts to \"paralyze\" U.S. climate action its \"most dangerous collision with facts.\"\n\nBut there is yet another goal to the letter, according to Holland: \"To offer clear support\" to career officers still working on climate and security issues within the federal bureaucracy.\n\nIn January, for instance, the national intelligence director delivered a worldwide threat assessment on \"climate hazards\" such as extreme weather and acidifying oceans, which threaten \"infrastructure, health, and water and food security.\"\n\nAnd in November, scientists from 13 federal agencies published a National Climate Assessment that concluded that \"the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country.\"\n\nIn an indication of where the White House panel is headed, Charles Kupperman, deputy national security adviser, said during the Situation Room meeting that Trump was upset that his administration had issued the National Climate Assessment at, The Post reported last week.\n\nRead more here:\n\n-- Half-a-dozen energy and environmental rollbacks championed by the Trump administration will, if enacted, generate an additional 209 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to a new report released Tuesday by NYU Law School's State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.\n\nThe analysis, which was unveiled by the attorneys general from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York, calculated the emissions associated with rules affecting the coal, automotive, oil and gas and solid waste industry. Most of the rules have been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. By 2025 these regulatory changes would spur greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to the annual output of nearly 54 coal-fired power plants, according to the report, or nearly 15 percent of the nation's current fleet.\n\nMaryland Attorney Brian Frosh told reporters that President Trump vowed during the 2016 campaign that he would be \"a change agent. And unfortunately, he has. He has become an agent of climate change.\" \"He has targeted fossil fuels not to decrease their emissions or their threat to society, but to increase their emissions,\" Frosh said. The attorneys general said that they would continue to challenge the administration in court as they continued to rewrite the nation's air and water policy. \"We will sue EPA at every change we get,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nEPA spokeswoman Molly Block said the agency \"has not reviewed the report.\" The EPA has estimated its replacement of Obama's Clean Power Plan -- one of the rules analyzed in the report -- could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1.5 percent by 2030 from projected levels.\n\n-- Juliet Eilperin\n\n-- McConnell vows Green New Deal will get vote soon: After telling reporters last week the resolution would get a vote in the Senate sometime before the August recess, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the chamber would vote on proposal in \"the next couple of weeks,\" Politico reports. Other Republicans continued a line of rhetorical attack on the plan, with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) penned a USA Today op-ed calling the Green New Deal \"unworkable and unaffordable.\" Politico reports, meanwhile, that Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) is putting himself in \"a leading role in his party's resistance.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep at this\": Yet again, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized McConnell's planned vote as a \"political stunt.\" On the Senate floor, Schumer referred to a climate resolution he's announced, with backing from the entire Senate Democratic caucus, saying \"we're not locking anyone in to this proposal or that proposal, we're simply saying let's start talking about it.\" He added: \"Actually... the one good thing about Leader McConnell's stunt, we are talking about it.\"\n\n-- He's not running: Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday he will not throw his hat into the already hat-filled ring for president. \"Advisers said he ultimately decided not to run after concluding he could accomplish more through his political activism and philanthropic work over the next two years, and by focusing on such issues as gun violence, opioid addiction and climate change,\" The Post's Michael Scherer reports.\n\nWhat Bloomberg will do instead: \"Bloomberg plans to increase his investment in a philanthropic effort called Beyond Coal, which has worked to shutter coal-fired power plants in recent years, and to launch a new effort called Beyond Carbon, with the goal of largely eliminating the use of gas, oil and coal in the United States by 2050.\"\n\n-- \"It's directly impacting our way of life\": During the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee's first hearing of the year on climate change, Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski said addressing energy concerns amid global warming will be a \"priority for all of us.\" The Alaska Republican said the panel will prioritize efforts including \"keeping energy affordable and advancing cleaner technology that can help reduce greenhouse gases.\" She also lamented how climate change is impacting her home state of Alaska. \"In the Arctic we're seeing warming at over twice the average of the rest of the Lower 48. It is directly impacting our way of life,\" the panel's chair said. \"It's diminishing sea ice and melting permafrost...It's impacting subsistence. It's impacting food security. It's certainly impacting our economy with our fisheries.\"\n\nJoe Manchin III, the panel's top Democrat from the coal-producing state of West Virginia, too said \"all communities, including those in energy-producing states like West Virginia and Alaska, are experiencing the harmful impacts of the climate crisis.\" He added that solution to that crisis must not put \"additional economic burdens\" on states like his already hurting from the downturn in coal.\n\n-- EPA blocked NASA plane from reviewing hurricane-ravaged Houston: Following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, NASA scientists wanted to fly a pollution-monitoring plane over the hurricane zone following the catastrophe that caused chemical spills and damaged industrial plants. But the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Texas stopped that from happening, the Los Angeles Times reports. The state's director of toxicology Michael Honeycutt told NASA officials: \"At this time, we don't think your data would be useful.\" EPA deferred to Honeycutt, and the \"response stunned NASA scientists, many of whom had flown similar missions in the past, including over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\n-- Lawmakers want answers on WWF after BuzzFeed report: Two lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the World Wide Fund for Nature, better known as WWF, following an extensive report from BuzzFeed News revealed it has equipped and helped fund \"paramilitary forces that have been accused of beating, torturing, sexually assaulting, and murdering scores of people.\" \"I strongly support efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, but this must not come at the cost of the health, safety, or life of innocent civilians,\" House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, according to BuzzFeed, while Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called for an \"immediate and thorough review\" of the United States' support of the charity.\n\n-- Ocean heat waves are happening more frequently: A new study found they're happening more often than they did last century and it's having a negative impact on marine life, the New York Times reports. The heat waves, which happen when sea temperatures are warmer than normal for at least five straight days, are damaging ocean ecosystems, including for kelp forests, sea grass beds and coral reefs. \"Scientists estimate that the oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by excess greenhouse gases since midcentury,\" the Times reports. \"This excess heat is increasing not only baseline ocean temperatures but also the frequency and duration of marine heat waves.\"\n\n-- Forbidding foam: Maryland is one step closer to becoming the first state to prohibit plastic foam cups and food containers after a bill to do gained final approval in the state Senate. It now moves on to be considered in the state House, The Post's Ovetta Wiggins and Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez report. Lawmakers in Hawaii are also considering a statewide ban and some cities, like New York, Miami and the District, already bar foam food and beverage containers. \"Support for the foam ban fell largely along partisan lines, with all Democrats backing it except Sen. Katherine A. Klausmeier (Baltimore County), who said she worried about the impact on small businesses,\" they write. \"Opponents of the bill said they were not certain it would help the environment as much as proponents claimed.\"\n\n-- Oil giants announce big plans for Permian output: In the coming years, oil giants Chevron and Exxon want to boost production in the \"heart of the American fracking boom,\" the Permian Basin, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"In the next five years, Chevron expects to more than double its production in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico to 900,000 barrels of oil and gas a day... That is a nearly 40% rise from its previous forecast,\" the Journal reports. \"Not to be outdone, Exxon on Tuesday announced plans to increase its Permian output to one million barrels of oil and gas a day by as early as 2024.\" The moves are the latest signal that major oil companies will drive future expansion of shale drilling.\n\n-- Here's your next cold-weather activity: Next time the air turns frigid, try making frozen bubbles, The Post's Matthew Cappucci suggests.",

    "title": "India's Kerala to give workers a siesta to help beat the heat",
    "body": "MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Workers in India's Kerala state are now getting a three-hour afternoon siesta as part of a series of benefits aimed at combating soaring temperatures and improving labor conditions, government officials said on Wednesday.\n\nKerala, which suffered its worst floods in a century last year, is bracing itself for more extreme weather conditions in 2019 and the state's disaster management authority last week issued sunstroke warnings for the next three months.\n\n\"There is extreme heat in Kerala. So we are making arrangements for workers and have announced a three-hour break from noon until 3 p.m.,\" said Sreedharan Tulasidharan, a labor commissioner with the Kerala government.\n\nThere are an estimated 3 million migrant workers in Kerala, which offers daily wages that are up to three times higher than in other Indian states, labor rights campaigners say.\n\nMost work in the construction, agriculture, mining and fishing industries.\n\n\"We call them our guests. Migrant workers' output is very high. Their productivity contributes to our GDP. We are nurturing and treating them well,\" Tulasidharan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n\nClimate experts have warned that the world can expect higher temperatures and more frequent heat waves, with the poorest communities likely to be worst-affected as the impacts of climate change kick-in.\n\nThe World Health Organization says heat-stress, linked to climate change, is likely to cause 38,000 extra deaths a year worldwide between 2030 and 2050.\n\nHome to 60 percent of the world's population, Asia-Pacific is the planet's most disaster-prone region, according to the Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2017.\n\nIndia, with approximately 1.3 billion people, is the second most populous country in the world and also among the most disaster-prone. Heat waves in India caused over 2,400 deaths in 2015, according to government data.\n\nOfficials of the Kerala's disaster management authority said cases of heat stroke and sunburn were already being reported and they had asked various government departments to take precautionary measures.\n\n\"Summer in Kerala was never harsh,\" said Sekhar L. Kuriakose, a senior official with the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, which issued the sunstroke warning last week.\n\n\"This year we saw temperatures rise by 3 degrees in 14 days during February. That is not normal,\" said Kuriakose.\n\nKerala announced health and pension benefits for migrant workers in November.\n\nLast week, the state inaugurated hostels for migrant workers in Palakkad town and now plans to expand the scheme.\n\nWith high levels of literacy and an aging population, Kerala leans heavily on migrant workers, said Benoy Peter, executive director at Kerala's Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, a non-profit.",

    "title": "5 myths about staying warm in cold weather",
    "body": "You might assume that fans are just for summer. After all, why would you want to spread air around the room in the winter? Sounds draughty. In fact many ceiling fans have a reverse setting, specifically aimed at use when temperatures are low. Heat rises of course, which means that the nice warm air above your radiators heads on up towards the ceiling, rather than where you'd most like it - at sitting height if you're in your living room. This is more of a problem in rooms with very high ceilings. Picture a glossy office building with a tall atrium. Thermal stratification occurs, with warmer air near the ceiling and cooler air lower down where the people sit. So the idea is that if a fan is run on a low setting in reverse, destratification will take place. The nice hot air will be sent from the ceiling back down the walls into the room where it can recirculate and warm you up.\n\nResearch on this has tended to focus on workplaces where businesses are trying to keep vast buildings warm. In warehouses it's been estimated that the correct use of ceiling fans can reduce energy use by 3% per metre of ceiling height, not inconsiderable in a building that might be 10m (33ft) tall.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nInstructions for fans tend to suggest running them in reverse in winter (clockwise), in order to draw the air up, but not everyone agrees. There is some interesting unpublished research from Holly Samuelson at Harvard University from 2015.\n\nShe tested two types of domestic fan on forward and reverse settings in rooms of three different heights. The reverse setting led to warmer air down near the ground, but the forward setting that you would usually use in summer, resulted in warmer air at torso height. So, if you'd like warm feet, then put it on reverse. If you prefer the rest of your body to be warm, put it on the normal setting. She found it was even more successful if the fan was run at a medium rather than a low speed, although then of course you do risk sitting in a draught.\n\nIf you happen to have a large living room with a ceiling fan in the middle and chairs around the edge, far enough away not to feel the draught, then this research would suggest that forward mode on medium would save the most energy while keeping you warm.\n\nVERDICT: MYTH - depending on how your room is arranged a fan on a low setting might help spread the heat around the room.\n\nIf you've been out in the snow, what could be better than a nip of something alcoholic to warm you up? Hipflasks have been carried in the mountains since the 18th Century and mulled wine is still popular in ski resorts today as people come off the slopes and head into a bar to warm up.\n\nIt is true that if you drink an alcoholic drink when you're cold you will feel as though you're getting warmer and you'll look as if you are. The alcohol sends blood towards the surface of the skin, making you flush. If you touch your face it will feel hotter. The problem is the blood has moved away from the main parts of your body, so in fact your core temperature drops.\n\nAlcohol can reduce the body's natural shivering response and dampen your perception of cold\n\nThe good news is that the discomfort starts to lessen and if you're now indoors a slight initial drop in core body temperature won't matter. The problem is that if you're staying out in the cold the effect of blood moving to the skin is not enough to keep you warm for long. Or if you drink a lot and then go back out into the cold, you could put yourself at risk. Alcohol can reduce the body's natural shivering response and dampen your perception of cold.\n\nCombine this with the impaired judgement that of course goes with being drunk, and you can see why people sometimes end up in dangerous situations. We've all seen the stories of people who fall into icy ditches on their way home from a bar in the freezing cold. Figures from the US show that, in a decade, 10% of deaths due to hypothermia involved alcohol consumption.\n\nVERDICT: HALF TRUE - it warms your skin which gives you the sensation of feeling warmer, but your core body temperature can drop. In excess it can increase your chances of hypothermia.\n\nThis is a myth that's been around for a while. Another is that sitting on cold surfaces gives you piles. Haemorrhoids or piles are itchy, bumpy swellings that develop from the cushions of tissue lining the anal canal. They affect as many as 50% of people at some point of their lives.\n\nCooling the region can give some people relief, but there's no evidence that warm temperatures cause them or make them worse. In fact a German study found that people who had a bath at least once a week (which presumably would be hot) had a lower risk of developing piles. (The study can be found here, but be warned that it contains graphic images).\n\nPeople are at higher risk if they often have constipation and strain when they go to the loo.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE - sitting on radiators doesn't give you piles. The best way to lower your risk is to eat plenty of fibre such as vegetables, cereals and nuts, avoid becoming overweight and drink water.\n\n4) Don't go out with wet hair or you'll get a cold\n\nMy guess is a lot of us were told this by our grandparents. I certainly was. The name \"cold\" even suggests you catch it by going outside in low temperatures. The illness is of course caused by a virus and unless you catch that virus, you can't develop a cold. But could getting chilled make you more susceptible?\n\nIn research where volunteers' temperatures were lowered before exposing them to a cold virus, some studies found the shivering group were more likely to develop a cold, others that it made no difference. But Ron Eccles from Cardiff University in the UK tried something different.\n\nPeople had to sit with their feet in cold water for 20 minutes, before returning to their normal lives. The control group kept their shoes and socks on and simply sat with their feet in an empty bucket for 20 minutes. Five days later twice as many people in the cold water group said they now had a cold. It should be said that the study did rely on the volunteers' own assessments.\n\nBut why should having wet feet or maybe wet hair make you more likely to catch a cold? One suggestion is that because when you're feeling cold the blood vessels in the nose and throat constrict, meaning that fewer infection-fighting white blood cells reach your nose and throat to tackle the virus.\n\nOthers suggest that people simply get more colds in winter because they stay inside together and pass their germs around more easily. When Anice Lowen from Emory School of Medicine in the US studied how easily the flu virus passes from one guinea pig to another, she found the warm temperatures with low humidity (typical of a centrally heated house in winter) were ideal circumstances for passing on the infection.\n\nVERDICT: MORE DATA NEEDED - going out in the cold with wet hair won't give you a cold, but it's possible that if you have already picked up the virus your body might find it harder to fight it.\n\n5) Always wear a hat because you lose the most heat from your head\n\nObviously it makes sense to cover up well if you're heading out into the snow, but is it true that it's especially important to keep your head warm?\n\nHardy volunteers have taken part in plenty of unpleasant research on this in the hope of finding some answers. In one study Thea Pretorius from the University of Manitoba in Canada gave volunteers drugs which prevented the body from shivering. Then they were lowered into cold water wearing scuba tanks for breathing. They wore dry suits, socks and gloves or just a swimming costume. Sometimes their heads stayed above the surface of the water. At other times they were completely submerged.\n\nIf they were submerged but wearing the dry suit, their heat loss was mostly from their heads, but they lost only half as much heat as those in swimming costumes with their heads sticking up above the water. Since they were losing heat almost entirely from their bodies, this shows we lose more heat from our bodies than from our heads.\n\nIt is also true that if the body is insulated, but the head is exposed to the cold, the body's core temperature still drops faster than you'd expect, possibly because we don't shiver if only our head is cold and the reason we shiver is of course to warm us up. Also there are a lot of blood vessels on the scalp close to the surface of the skin, so if blood is cooled as it passes through the scalp, it can then cool the rest of the body as it passes through.\n\nBut this concerns the rate of cooling, rather than the lowest temperature your body reaches. When it's freezing outside, what usually matters to you is how cold you end up. So the ideal is to keep the rest of your body and your head well covered.",

    "body": "Scientist compares spiking temperatures to devastating wildfires in the sea.\n\nThe number of days of intense heat waves in the ocean have increased more than 50 percent in the last 30 years and have devastated marine ecosystems when they've hit, according to a new study.\n\nSeveral regions in the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean are particularly vulnerable to the water temperature surges because of their fragile biodiversity and a prevalence of species already at their \"warm range edges,\" according to the study published Monday in Nature Climate Change.\n\nCoral reefs in the Caribbean, seagrass in Australia and kelp forests off California, all rooted in their environments, have been particularly hurt by heat waves, according to the study. The loss of these \"critical foundation species\" in an intricate ecosystem can trigger a cascading die-off -- that ultimately affects humans -- as shelter is destroyed and the food chain is broken.\n\nLead researcher Dan Smale of the Marine Biological Association in Britain compared the extreme heat to wildfires.\n\n\"You have heatwave-induced wildfires that take out huge areas of forest, but this is happening underwater as well,\" he told The Guardian. \"You see the kelp and seagrasses dying in front of you. Within weeks or months they are just gone, along hundreds of [miles] of coastline.\"\n\nThe study, which analyzed a broad range of data from other research, noted that \"record-breaking events have been observed in most ocean basins in the past decade.\" Projections indicate that the heat waves will become \"more frequent, more intense and longer lasting throughout the 21st century,\" according to the study.\n\nOceans are bearing the brunt of global warming, absorbing some 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases since the middle of the last century, scientists estimate. Areas of sea now suffer the added stress of the heat waves, which are defined as at least five consecutive days when temperatures are abnormally high.",

    "title": "Hawks' Kevin Huerter gets a surprise from childhood idol Dwyane Wade with jersey swap",
    "body": "Miami's Dwyane Wade, right, and Atlanta's Kevin Huerter show off the memorabilia they just acquired. (Wilfredo Lee/AP) By Des Bieler Des Bieler Sports reporter covering national topics, including fantasy football, as well as supporting coverage of D.C.-area teams March 5 at 1:06 AM\n\nWhile Dwyane Wade's intention to commemorate games in his final season with a jersey swap was originally meant for close friends such as LeBron James and Chris Paul, he recently acknowledged that the soccer-style ritual had \"taken on a life of its own\" and quickly extended the gesture to all sorts of NBA opponents. Still, after Monday's Heat-Hawks contest, the 13-time all-star got a surprised reaction when he indicated that he wanted to trade game-worn apparel with Atlanta's Kevin Huerter.\n\nThe Hawks' rookie shooting guard, drafted 19th overall last year out of the University of Maryland, was only too happy to participate in the ritual. Afterward, Wade said he was well aware that he was Huerter's childhood idol.\n\n\"Earlier in the year, a good friend of mine told me about [Huerter] when he was younger, that he used to wear my shoes, he wore No. 3 because of me, he looked up to me,\" he said. \"So I knew I was going to surprise him after the last time we played [the Hawks].\n\n\"I really like his game. He's someone that, ever since preseason when we played them, all the way up till now, he's gotten so much better.\n\n\"So from one No. 3 to another,\" Wade added with a smile, \"I thought I'd switch jerseys with him.\"\n\nHuerter, 20, didn't hesitate to offer words of praise in the other direction, saying of Wade (via the AP), \"He's always done it the right way. You never hear him with off-court type of stuff. He brought championships to this city. He's been with the Heat for the majority of his career. He's been loyal to them.\n\n\"And as a guy coming up, a young guy, starting out with the Hawks, I hope I can continue a long career with them. The league's going to miss him, for sure.\"\n\nWhile Wade, 37, has billed this season as \"one last dance,\" he's not exactly shuffling stiffly around the ballroom. His player efficiency rating is a solid 15.3 and his per-36 statistics aren't far off his numbers from an overall career that will soon see him enshrined in basketball's Hall of Fame.\n\nThe three-time NBA champion authored one of the season's more memorable moments last week when he banked in an off-balance three-pointer to beat the Warriors, and on Monday he made the difference in a one-point Heat win, 114-113 over the Hawks. Wade scored 14 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter, including a vintage drive to the hoop for his team's final points with under a minute to play.\n\n\"That's textbook, Hall of Fame poise,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of his veteran star. \"He's playing his best basketball of the season right now.\"\n\nAlong the way, Wade made history by passing Michael Jordan with his 1,052nd blocked shot, more than any other guard in NBA history when playoff games are included. His performance and subsequent gesture had a guard now on the first leg of his NBA journey recalling the impact Wade made.\n\n\"For as long as I can remember, me and my brother would wear his shoes when we were younger,\" Huerter said. \"We'd watch his game. He was really one of the first NBA guys I looked up to.\"\n\n\"I always want to be someone that a player like that can count on, can reach out to,\" Wade said, adding that the jersey swap was \"a cool moment\" for him, as well.\n\nAfter a Heat-Hawks game in November, Wade traded jerseys with a decidedly more likely suspect in fellow living legend Vince Carter, and made a widely noted swap last month with the Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki, who is also thought to be in his final season. Wade has performed the postgame honor with the Warriors' Steph Curry and the Pelicans' Anthony Davis, as well as with lesser-known players like the Magic's Nikola Vicevic, the Jazz's Jae Crowder, the Raptors' Delon Wright and the Cavaliers' Collin Sexton.\n\nOh, and even Chicago mascot Benny the Bull, representing Wade's hometown, got into the act.\n\n\"Couldn't say enough about D-Wade and what he has been to this league and, honestly, what he has been for my development,\" Thunder all-star Paul George said after swapping jerseys with Wade following an OKC-Miami game in February. \"He played a huge role in my development and who I am now as a player.\"\n\nOn Monday, Wade singled out another, much younger player who has also regarded him as a role model. He said of Huerter, \"The look on his face, I understood it meant a lot to him.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to get it framed,\" Huerter said of new, prized possession.\n\nKyrie Irving has fans worried, but Kevin Durant says Celtics will be 'fine' once playoffs start\n\nFurious Snoop Dogg wants Luke Walton fired, Lakers players moved out on a 'slave ship'\n\nTrae Young got ejected for .\u2009.\u2009. staring at his opponent's back?\n\nThe Redskins need a quarterback.
