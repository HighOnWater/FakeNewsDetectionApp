By tweaking the materials\\' chemical composition, the researchers could control how much they shrank at different temperatures. This work could apply to everything from circuitry to dentistry.\\n\\nSupport Provided ByLearn More\\n\\nMany devices warp or break at high temperatures because they\\'re made of metal, glass, or other normal solids that expand as they get hotter. Manufacturers can create sturdier devices if they incorporate some components that contract at higher heat, giving other pieces room to expand without breaking. But such shrinking solids are extremely rare. As a result, scientists have been trying since the mid-\\'90s to fabricate them in the lab.\\n\\nThe new 3D-printed \"lattices\" are grid-like structures mere millimeters across and are made up of tiny interlocking rods. Some of the rods are pure plastic; others are infused with copper nanoparticles. As they heat up, the pure-plastic beams swell faster than their copper-infused counterparts, bending in towards the center of the lattice and pulling the copper-reinforced rods along with them. This effectively causes the whole structure to crumple in on itself, said Qiming Wang, an engineer at the University of Southern California and lead author on the new study.\\n\\nTo test the lattices\\' shrinkage, Wang\\'s team placed them inside a glass chamber and turned up the heat. As the chamber went from room temperature to 540 degrees Fahrenheit, the 3D-printed structures initially maintained their size and then gradually contracted. This work is described in Physical Review Letters .\\n\\nThe sugar-cube-sized lattices only shrink about the width of a human hair on each side, said Nick Fang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and coauthor on the new study. But even this small change in size could make a big difference to engineers using these materials to build high-precision optical and mechanical devices. \"This work is very innovative,\" said Akihiro Takezawa, an engineer at Hiroshima University who is unaffiliated with the project.\\n\\nRelatedA Twin Towers\\' Survivor StorySaving Venice From the SeaStable Isotopes in Forensics\\n\\nAccording to Takezawa, these materials could be especially useful because of their tunable quality. Wang\\'s team could control how much the lattices shrank at different temperatures by changing how many nanoparticles they injected into the copper-infused rods. It\\'s also possible to fine-tune the lattices\\' shrinkage by altering the width and orientation of their rods, Fang said.\\n\\nWang and his colleagues have proposed myriad uses for their new 3D-printed products. Take microchips, for example. When computers operate for a long time, they tend to heat up, which can cause their microchips to crack. Fashioning some microchip components that contract at higher temperatures could help computers withstand overheating. The researchers\\' current 3D-printing method could construct samples less than a millimeter across, \"so current technology is already good for microchip applications,\" Wang said.\\n\\nThe lattices could similarly be used to build sturdier drone cameras, Fang said. If a drone flies up even 10 meters on a hot summer day, the increased temperature can cause the camera lens to expand. A contracting frame around the lens could act as a buffer that would keep a swelling lens from breaking the camera.\\n\\nFang said that the new 3D-printed materials could even be used to make something as simple as a dental filling. Unlike normal metal or plastic fillings, non-expanding fillings wouldn\\'t cause a toothache when the wearer drinks a hot beverage.\\n\\nThe lattices also might be used in ways that scientists haven\\'t even considered yet, said Jonathan Berger, a mechanical engineer at the University of California, Santa Barbara who was not involved in the study. It\\'s difficult to compile a full list of applications, he said, \"for these materials that theoretically you can do completely new things with.\"\\n\\nThe next step for Wang\\'s team is to devise a speedier method of manufacturing lattices. Some of the biggest structures printed for this study -- each only a centimeter or so across -- took 12 hours to make. But Wang hopes that eventually 3D-printing will provide a cheap, relatively easy way for designers and engineers to produce tunable materials for more heat-resistant tech.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a long road to travel to get these kinds of lattices into airplanes or circuit boards where there\\'s a huge established industry,\" Berger said. \"But it\\'ll be really exciting to see where this technology goes.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'pbs.org', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'PBS NewsHour', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 20, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1548, 'alexaCountryRank': 453}}, 'authors': [], 'links': ['https://help.pbs.org/support/solutions/articles/5000677869-online-sponsorship-support/'], 'image': '/wgbh/nova/_next/static/images/default_share-84f47c2f4c96ec8326721f99e837e424.png', 'eventUri': None, 'shares': {}, 'sentiment': 0.1607843137254903, 'wgt': 7}\n",

That could cause to cloud decks break up into smaller cumulus clouds that don\\'t do much in the way of shade or reflecting sunshine back into space.\\n\\nUsing a supercomputer, Schneider\\'s group simulated how different concentrations of atmospheric carbon would impact the longevity of stratocumulus clouds. When the simulation hit 1,200 ppm (roughly three times the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today), these critical clouds vanished.\\n\\nWhile 1,200 ppm seems impossible high, it\\'s a level that \"business-as-usual\" greenhouse-gas emissions could get us to in a century or so. Once the tipping point is reached, those clouds are gone for good until carbon dioxide emissions are reduced.\\n\\nUltimately, the planet is at risk of warming a total of 12 degrees Celsius (20 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next 150 years if stratocumulus clouds reach this tipping point, Schneider\\'s simulation shows.\\n\\nSchneider said that the cloud decks would come back once carbon dioxide levels decreased below the tipping point mark. But he added that even if this occurred, it wouldn\\'t do much to reverse the effects of the heat wave on melting ice sheets and rising sea-levels that would have already happened.\\n\\nOnce clouds go away, the simulated climate \"goes over a cliff,\" Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Quartz.\\n\\nSchneider thinks this cloud tipping point could shed light on a mystery that\\'s long baffled researchers. Nearly 56 million years ago, the Earth experienced a \"hothouse climate\" in which there was a heat spike of 11 degrees Fahrenheit over 20,000 years. During that time, oceans hit 100-plus degrees Fahrenheit temperatures and the Arctic melted.\\n\\nIn order for the planet to have warmed that quickly, climate models show that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would have had to be twice as high as scientists have found evidence for in the geologic record.\\n\\nRead More: World at risk of heading toward irreversible \\'hothouse\\' state\\n\\nPerhaps clouds were the missing piece of the puzzle.\\n\\nIf carbon dioxide levels reached the tipping point at which stratocumulus clouds disappeared, and the clouds\\' absence contributed to additional warming, that might explain why the models and the evidence don\\'t match up.\\n\\n\"This has been a conundrum in climate modeling,\" Schneider said. \"But this could be that mechanism that explains how we had a climate that warm.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'businessinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Business Insider', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 15, 'alexaGlobalRank': 312, 'alexaCountryRank': 97}}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'aylin_woodward@businessinsider.com', 'name': 'Aylin Woodward', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'links': ['https://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/07/12/study_cloud_patterns_are_shifting_because_of_climate_change.html', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/r-world-at-risk-of-heading-toward-irreversible-hothouse-state-2018-8', 'https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/r-world-at-risk-of-heading-toward-irreversible-hothouse-state-2018-8'], 'image': 'https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c76a64a262898345c249717-2732-1366.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4630246', 'shares': {'facebook': 95}, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 7}\n",

Recently a new study in the AGU journal Geophysical Research Letters talks about how such a thing might be possible and how it can change the way we look at and study Mars.\\n\\nWhat we know\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge, the detection of liquid water under the ice cap has not yet been confirmed. The new study assumes the reading to be correct and focuses on how the existence of liquid water might be possible. This study could play a key role in confirmation as it will give scientists a better understanding of what to look for in future missions.\\n\\nThe new study\\n\\nCurrently, scientists do not know how it could have gotten there but there are two factors that could be contributing to the existence of liquid water. One factor is the presence of salt which would keep the water from freezing. The new study considers this possibility but concludes that on Mars salt alone is not enough to account for the water. The other contributing factor is heat.\\n\\nOn Earth, the heat from the planet's core melts the water under the ice caps. Which means that there is a reason to think that something similar could be happening on Mars. In order for that to be the case, it would require recent volcanic activity on the red planet.\\n\\nVolcanic activity on Mars has been studied before and there is plenty of evidence of it happening. However, up until now, that evidence points to volcanic events that are millions of years old. Anything that old would not be a factor with liquid ice existing today. It requires a pocket of magma that is only a few hundred thousand years old.\\n\\nThe study points out that it could be the work of volcanic activity in the subsurface of the planet. If magma rose from the core 300,000 years ago and did not break the surface it could be providing heat to the underside of the ice cap today. Which would mean that Mars is more geologically active than previously thought.\\n\\nWhy does this matter?\\n\\nTo put it simply, liquid water under the ice cap points to the possibility of life on Mars. Just a possibility but its still pretty exciting.\\n\\nThe study is not conclusive and really just points out that more research needs to be done to confirm the existence of liquid water. If confirmed it will change the way scientists study Mars and could teach us a lot about our own planet.\", 'source': {'uri': 'forbes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Forbes', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 13, 'alexaGlobalRank': 250, 'alexaCountryRank': 92}}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'kevin_anderton@forbes.com', 'name': 'Kevin Anderton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'links': ['https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL080985'], 'image': 'https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fkevinanderton%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F02%2FWater-on-Mars-Square-500x500.png', 'eventUri': 'eng-4601537', 'shares': {}, 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 7}\n",

I\\'m snorkeling with coral ecologist Hannah Barkley in blue-green Nikko Bay, where limestone mushrooms jut from the water to form the kind of terrain you\\'d expect around a Bond villain\\'s lair. Here in the Rock Islands of Palau, natural conditions offer a glimpse into the Pacific Ocean expected by the end of this century -- when it\\'s acidified by dissolved carbon dioxide from an overladen atmosphere. By all rights we should see a dire, climate-changed wasteland.\\n\\nBut the corals here look fine.\\n\\nSupport Provided ByLearn More\\n\\nBetter than fine. It\\'s gorgeous, an explosion in a paint factory. Tropical fish flit between tumorous yellow mounds, rusty ginger roots, and red-orange pancake stacks topped with stalactites. Some aged coral clumps are tipped to the side like fallen trees, their bone-white bases exposed, but new shoots are springing up perpendicularly toward the sun. When we surface, Barkley is grinning ear to ear.\\n\\nIt\\'s Barkley\\'s sixth time in Palau, and the seventh trip to the Micronesian country for Anne Cohen\\'s lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, where Barkley is a Ph.D. student. What began as a fact-finding mission in preparation for climate change has blossomed into something bigger, more prognostic, and more hopeful.\\n\\nThe bad news first: over the next century of climate change, all coral reefs will have to contend with two inextricable, inexorable pressures. One is global warming, where hotter ocean temperatures will lead to the wide-scale \"bleaching\" of reefs. The second is ocean acidification. About a third of the carbon dioxide we add to the atmosphere ends up mixing with the seas, souring the oceans for the many creatures that scaffold their squishy bodies with hard shells made from the mineral aragonite.\\n\\nBut to their surprise, Cohen\\'s team has found that the corals in Nikko Bay and a few other naturally acidified Rock Island sites seem to be shrugging off this sneak preview of the coral-reef apocalypse. If these locales can be preserved, ecologists think they might have a better chance of surviving climate change than anywhere else in the Palauan archipelago.\\n\\nToday, Nikko Bay, with its warm, acidified water and healthy corals, sits precariously at the intersection of three worlds. Scientists are forging on with their studies, engrossed in the minutiae of what makes these corals special, conservationists are holding it up as a reason for optimism, and Palauans, tied to the sea, are trying to save these reefs while they still can.\\n\\nAnne Cohen describes the discovery in Palau.\\n\\nA single event binds them all together. In 1998, heat waves from a vicious El Niño event devastated reefs across the globe. The sudden loss of 16% of the world\\'s coral cast a shadow into the future, toward what some experts are calling the \"end of reefs.\" But this cataclysm also inspired conservationists to look for pockets of climate-change resistance, and it pressed Palau to invest in the very research infrastructure that would make Cohen\\'s later work possible.\\n\\nAnd in its wake, the El Niño brought the first hints that the bays between Palau\\'s Rock Island might be worth a close look.\\n\\nBorn in a Crisis\\n\\nYimnang Golbuu, Cohen\\'s main Palauan collaborator, grew up in a neighborhood with one black-and-white TV. He spent his childhood outside -- fishing, swimming, hunting small geckos in the forest -- before crossing the Pacific to major in biology at the University of California, Davis.\\n\\nCompared with Palau, Golbuu tells me, the winters in California were intolerable. After surviving the cold temperatures, the ecological train wreck of Guam, where he subsequently went for his master\\'s degree, was distressing. One thought kept him going: \"I\\'m going to come back to Palau,\" Golbuu says.\\n\\nBut shortly after he returned, the reefs he loved went to hell. The El Niño of \\'98, like Niños in other years, saw a break in the winds that push water across the Pacific. Stagnant currents changed weather patterns on a global scale, subjecting tropical reefs worldwide to weeks and weeks of warmer-than-usual water.\\n\\nIn 50 countries, the photosynthetic algae that live inside corals and help feed them short-circuited in the heat, releasing destructive free radicals. Perturbed by the conduct of their tenants, the host corals expelled their algae to limit the damage.\\n\\nNormally, the turquoise shoals between Palau\\'s Rock Islands show dark patches of coral against the sandy bottom. When the bleaching hit, these shadows turned white. The corals no longer had their algae; the colorful pigments inside were gone. As a result, giant swaths of these bleached corals starved and died.\\n\\nOn land, Palau was stricken by drought. The trees that jostle to fill every nook and cranny of the Rock Islands wilted, repainting Palau\\'s most scenic, unique landscape in rustlike tones. Groundwater in the populous, porous karst island of Koror dried up, forcing residents to get their water from the volcanic island Babeldaob.\\n\\nIn the face of this climate-related hardship, the need for reef conservation and research in a nation so dependent on marine resources could no longer be ignored. Three years after the crisis, the Palau International Coral Reef Center, also known as PICRC, was born. Palau had beat out several other Pacific countries for funding from Japan.\\n\\nOnce this research apparatus was in place, another consequence of the disastrous bleaching came into focus. Surveyors noticed a strange pattern when they started monitoring the nation\\'s reefs. \"We could see that some of the sites just are doing better than others,\" Golbuu says, over his desk. In 2012, Golbuu became perhaps the first Palauan to get a science Ph.D. It was covered in the newspaper, turning him into a local celebrity. We\\'re speaking in Golbuu\\'s air-conditioned office on the second floor of PICRC, where he is both CEO and head researcher.\\n\\nNot all the coral had been hammered. There were still spots that looked more or less intact. \"That kind of gave us a clue that things are different in these different sites,\" he says.\\n\\nBut because monitoring hadn\\'t yet begun at the onset of the El Niño event in 1998, there wasn\\'t a clear explanation for the healthy patches. Were some corals just bouncing back faster? Had the temperature not risen as high in those sites, causing less bleaching? Or had the corals themselves stubbornly resisted the heat?\\n\\nA smaller bleaching in 2010 helped settle the question in favor of that last -- and perhaps most intriguing -- possibility. PICRC researchers went out and surveyed 80 coral communities across the archipelago. As before, some sites had bleached more than others. But how a spot fared didn\\'t seem to be explainable by records of temperature.\\n\\nSome reefs that didn\\'t bleach had been even hotter than reefs that did, showing that mild weather wasn\\'t saving these corals. Golbuu suspects that the harsh environment had made the corals tougher. \"And now these are the same sites that Anne [Cohen] is finding,\" he says. \"These are very acidic sites.\"\\n\\nCohen herself first came to Palau in April 2011, backed by the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. In yet another thread tracing back to the \\'98 bleaching, Cohen was offered several Pacific locations to visit; she chose Palau because of the research infrastructure that had sprung up in response to the crisis.\\n\\nCohen had heard that the enclosed bays had proved resistant to bleaching. And as a specialist in ocean acidification, she had a hunch that these same locales might also be responding to unusual chemistry.\\n\\nPalau\\'s Rock Islands, the 20-million-year-old backbones of ancient coral reefs, provide a pinball machine\\'s worth of obstacles for ocean water that trickles through toward the innermost bays. In Nikko Bay, where corals had weathered the \\'98 bleaching, water is trapped for months on end.\\n\\nIn these conditions, Cohen knew that the corals themselves could change the water chemistry. To build a skeleton, corals pull calcium and carbonate ions from the water and knit them into sturdy crystals of aragonite. This process is known as calcification. Just as breathing exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide, slowly spoiling the air in a closed space, calcification draws carbonate out of the water, making the process progressively harder. And the corals are literally breathing, too, which adds more carbon dioxide, which in turn acidifies the water even more. Carbonate gets even harder to come by.\\n\\nOcean acidification makes it increasingly difficult for corals to build their skeletons.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2011, Cohen sent a postdoctoral researcher, Katie Shamberger, and her grad student Barkley to test the water in those enclosed bays. It was true exploration, Barkley recalls. \"We basically looked at a map and said, \\'OK.\\' Where can we go that looks like it might be interesting?\" Even after they took the water samples, months passed before they knew how extreme conditions in the bays really were. The eureka moment happened not in Palau, but back at WHOI, after the samples were analyzed.\\n\\nBarkley can still picture a beaming Cohen walking into the lab to announce that Nikko Bay was significantly more acidic than the tipping point expected to mark the end of reefs. \"I was like \\'No way!\\' \" Barkley says. Having first seen Nikko Bay\\'s vibrant corals in person, it was hard to believe. \"It was wow ,\" Cohen recalls. \"These reefs are at 2100 A.D. These reefs are in the future.\"\\n\\nSeeking Refugia\\n\\nAs Palau was responding proactively to the \\'98 bleaching crisis, the Nature Conservancy embarked on a hunt for refugia, or reefs that might be least vulnerable to climate change. And in a coincidence almost too good to be true, the idea that led to this new strategy came in the Rock Islands of Palau.\\n\\nRod Salm, Cohen\\'s backer at the Nature Conservancy, is the well-spoken, well-traveled director of marine conservation for the Asia Pacific region. His resume is a naturalist\\'s fantasy: Mauritius, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and the Seychelles with the World Wildlife Fund in the 1970s; a doctorate studying the Chagos Archipelago in the middle of the Indian Ocean; then a stint in the new world, followed by four years in Indonesia and eight years in Oman.\\n\\nThen, in 1999, when Salm was stationed in Nairobi, an otherwise ordinary moment turned into a revelation. He was helping his daughter with a high school research project. Together, they drove to the Kenyan coast and chose a long, thin island running north to south. The east side faced the ocean, catching the morning sun; the west side was sheltered, with mangroves nearby and motes of sediment twinkling in the light each afternoon. This being just after the 1998 El Niño, Salm helped his daughter look for bleaching. Corals on the east side? White as bone. On the west side? Normal.\\n\\nIt was puzzling. Later that year, Salm began travelling to coral reefs across the Pacific for his new job with the Nature Conservancy to survey the El Niño\\'s aftermath elsewhere: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands. \"I began suddenly to see patterns,\" Salm says, \"particularly in Palau.\"\\n\\nHis epiphany happened at Palau\\'s Cemetery Reef, where the corner of one of the Rock Islands arcs down to meet the water\\'s surface. Underneath, the slope continues, with green vegetation replaced by foliose corals the color of yellow ochre, stretching like giant sheets of lichen. At least, that\\'s how it looked in January 2015. When Salm first visited after the bleaching, all the corals were dead.\\n\\nAt the time, Salm had swum toward the island, over whitewashed corals and rubble, until he was halfway under the circumferential groove cut into each of the Rock Islands by grazing mollusks. Once his pupils adjusted to the shade, \"Suddenly I noticed that the corals under my fins were dead and the ones under my mask were alive,\" he says. \"That\\'s when it hit me.\"\\n\\nThe shade was saving the corals. It was embarrassingly obvious. It explained what he had seen in Kenya with his daughter: the sunnier side of the island had bleached, while the shaded side, with murkier water, had not. Heat plus bright light could cause the photosynthetic algae to release free radicals, causing corals to bleach. During heat waves, shadier places might stand a better chance. So might places where heat waves were buffered by deeper, colder water, an idea first suggested by researcher Peter Glynn in 1996 .\\n\\nThe El Niño of \\'98 had been a wakeup call to the threat posed by climate change, yet it left managers of marine protected areas with a sense of helplessness. Protecting reefs from humans was one thing: They could limit fishing, restrict where boats could anchor, oppose coastal development. Global warming was different, almost unstoppable. Neither coral scientists nor reef managers knew how deal with it.\\n\\nBut here was hope. While many coral-reef scientists were studying the death and destruction of \\'98 like photographers documenting war atrocities, Salm\\'s reaction was to pour resources into finding and studying the corals that hadn\\'t bleached. Managers would have the best chance to save these reefs.\\n\\nSalm first presented his idea in 2000 at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Bali. It struck a chord. Billy Causey, now a director of marine sanctuaries at NOAA, then superintendent of the Florida Keys sanctuary, commented that natural refugia could explain the bleaching pattern he had seen in the Keys. Afterward, the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy put down money for further research. A new paradigm had been born, balancing optimism with pragmatism. But there was little time to celebrate.\\n\\nBy 2005 and 2006, scientists had grown increasingly concerned about the impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide on ocean chemistry. Researchers, having seen corals struggle in aquarium tanks at low pH, could extrapolate out to a tipping point when the world\\'s reefs would dissolve faster than they could calcify. Algae would fill in the gaps. The world was on a \"slippery slope to slime,\" wrote coral ecologist John Pandolfi.\\n\\nCoral bleaching had been a shock when it first struck, a problem nothing in the conservationist toolbox could address. Strategies had to be developed after the fact. Yet this time, with ocean acidification, they had advance warning. The plan was to \"have a jump on it when it hit,\" Salm says.\\n\\nAnne Cohen explains why ocean acidification can only be solved through international cooperation.\\n\\nIn 2008, Salm convened a meeting of scientists and conservationists in Honolulu. Together, they crafted a strategic response to ocean acidification, which one attendee aptly described as osteoporosis of the reef. Among their recommendations: to search for biodiverse reefs that might be less vulnerable to ocean acidification.\\n\\nThanks to Salm\\'s work, one method for hunting down climate-change refugia -- seeking out places resistant to heat waves -- already existed. But it applied to bleaching, and acidification has a different profile. Bleaching happens in pulses, when waves of hot water wash over the reef. Ocean acidification is most often a steady pressure. They obey different oceanographic rules, too. Take the Galapagos, for example. There, the upwelling of cold water helps corals resist bleaching, but cold water also holds more carbon dioxide, making it more acidic. In other words, a refuge for one might not protect against the other.\\n\\nSalm met Cohen, an expert in carbonate chemistry and ocean acidification. He pushed her toward Palau, where Golbuu offered plenty of support, and where a wide range of habitats were thrown together in close proximity. And there they found far more than they\\'d bargained for.\\n\\nPicking Winners\\n\\nAfter Barkley and I get out of the water in Nikko, we head to another acidified yet healthy coral community in Palau, this one in Risong Bay just to the southwest. We\\'re pelted by angry pellets of rain, the boat bouncing jarringly over the waves.\\n\\nAs the boat slows to traverse a narrow channel, the trees above are nearly touching, their shadows reflected on the water\\'s surface with yellow boulder corals below. The boat emerges into a clearing, the Rock Islands curving around us. This is Chiropsalmus basin, named for a box jellyfish. Cohen\\'s team calls it the Jacuzzi.\\n\\nUsing a GPS device tied onto a buoy, Barkley and technical diver Pat Lohmann put on SCUBA gear and map the outlines of the coral growing underneath us. I snorkel above, thinking about refugia, wondering whether I\\'m swimming in one.\\n\\nWhen I ask Barkley whether Nikko Bay and Risong\\'s Jacuzzi are truly refugia, she refers me to the Nature Conservancy\\'s Elizabeth Mcleod, who works with Salm. Mcleod, with a measure of caution that\\'s common among ecologists, gently resists the poetic notion of refugia in favor of hard data. \"I would be uncomfortable if any scientist says that we know that this area is definitively a refuge,\" she says.\\n\\nPerhaps it helps to unpack the idea of a refuge, where creatures survive and then go forth to repopulate other areas. In Salm\\'s writings on climate change, he breaks down the search for \"less vulnerable\" spots into a few dimensions. First is avoidance: a particular place that is entirely spared from adverse conditions. Considering that warming and acidification are both global in scale, it won\\'t be easy to find reefs that can avoid them. Then there\\'s resistance: the ability of corals to experience heat waves and not die, or to live in acidified waters and keep growing. Resistance could be innate, the province of hardened, tough corals, as Cohen suspects is the case in Palau\\'s acidified bays. Or it could be environmental, like the shade Rod Salm saw in Kenya -- which may have also saved Nikko Bay\\'s corals from bleaching. It\\'s hard to untangle. And last is resilience, or a reef\\'s ability to grow back quickly and to send its larvae far and wide.\\n\\nPresently, with the worst of climate change still to come, reef refugia seem distant and abstract. But the ideal of a refuge -- the one weapon reef managers have against climate change, save a reduction in carbon emissions -- is still on the horizon. Perhaps Palau\\'s bays will pan out as climate change refugia, or perhaps what researchers learn in Palau will help them find refugia elsewhere. Knowing for sure will take time, which there isn\\'t much of.\\n\\nThere\\'s another way to put it, one that acknowledges a fundamental truth: conservation costs money, both to fund the research and to commit to saving a place. On the day I spoke to Salm, he mentioned spending an hour and a half on the phone with a donor. The donor, about to give a talk to students on the subject of winners and losers in business, intended to draw heavily on Salm\\'s philosophy. His idea was that since climate change conservation -- and perhaps life -- are inherent gambles, it makes sense to bet on proven winners.\\n\\nBack at the Jacuzzi reef, we climb out of the water, then return to Nikko Bay so that Barkley can take water samples. As we leave, beside two islands in the middle of the bay, we see a boat tugging an inflatable banana straddled by four whooping Asian tourists.\\n\\n\"This is your refugia?\" I say to Barkley, raising my voice over the engine and the wind. She laughs and yells back at me: the tourists could be doing worse.\\n\\nThe Other Threats\\n\\nOn my last night in Palau, Barkley and I meet for dinner at Taj, Palau\\'s surprisingly good Indian restaurant. \"The first time I jumped in Nikko Bay it was just breathtaking,\" she says. The reef was more colorful, rich, and diverse than any reef she\\'d ever dived on, and this was before the team knew how acidified it was. Learning that these corals were living in extreme conditions made it all the more amazing.\\n\\nBy now, thousands of water samples, numerous measurements, and myriad experiments over the seven trips to Palau have left the team confident about the response of corals to conditions in places like Nikko Bay. In the acidified spots, coral cover is high, diversity is high, and the reefs appear to be healthy. The problem lies in what to make of these facts.\\n\\n\"It\\'s really easy to assume that oh, well, Palau\\'s doing fine. Reefs don\\'t care about ocean acidification,\" Barkley tells me. The team has been careful to avoid saying anything like it. They haven\\'t even promised that they\\'ve found refugia. But Barkley still feels the work on Nikko Bay can be a source of hope. It means that somewhere, corals can survive these hostile conditions.\\n\\nOutside critics are in qualified agreement. Katharina Fabricius, a coral ecologist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, thinks that corals in locations like Nikko Bay are healthy only because the bays are so sheltered from storms. She also worries that despite Nikko Bay\\'s diversity, the main reef-building corals are absent -- a claim Cohen\\'s team hopes to parry in a new study to be released in the journal Science Advances in June. Whether or not the Palau results are an optimistic findings \"depends on how clear the caveats are expressed,\" Fabricius tells me.\\n\\nBarkley is working with Salm and Mcleod, who want a map of carbonate chemistry across the Palauan islands to compare with satellite data from elsewhere. \"We need to understand: what are those patterns?\" McLeod says. \"How do we identify those potential refugia across the archipelago without having to jump in the water and sample every coral?\" Barkley\\'s map, once produced, will inform searches for refugia around the world.\\n\\nUsing satellite images, Barkley has already found another place with a landscape similar to the Rock Islands, this time in Indonesia. Perhaps the pitted limestone islands there harbor acidification-resistant corals, too. But we\\'ll have to wait to find out -- a scouting trip planned for the spring of 2015 was scuttled when obtaining permits proved a challenge.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Barkley\\'s goal is to hand Golbuu and Palauan officials a stack of maps that show pH and climate change tolerance across the island system. That would indicate which places she thinks have the best chance of surviving ocean acidification over the next century.\\n\\nBut as Golbuu told me in his office, the lobbying to protect the acidified Rock Island bays has already started, even before Barkley\\'s comprehensive recommendation comes in. Nikko Bay is at particular risk because it is close to Palau\\'s population centers, making it more vulnerable to the traditional threats to reefs: pollution, development, and sediment runoff.\\n\\nThese corals \"might survive the end of this century,\" Golbuu says, \"but before then we\\'ll kill them with all the activities we do on land.\" Each year, Palau hosts more than 100,000 international tourists, over five times as many visitors as the nation has full-time residents. Even the most remote, pristine dive sites are ringed with tour boats.\\n\\nDevelopment projects, including a new highway that rings the large island of Babeldaob, are threats to the same inshore reefs that may be most resistant to climate change. A few Palauan reefs, which survived the \\'98 bleaching and might have been promising refugia candidates, have already been wiped out by the sand and dirt washing away from building projects.\\n\\nOn the day we spoke, Golbuu was weighing how to respond to the chief of Ngermid, the village bordering Nikko Bay. Palau\\'s traditional chiefs, who wield what he calls considerable \"non-Western\" power in parallel to the country\\'s modern political system, were very supportive of protecting Nikko Bay, he says, citing a concept called bul that provides the ethos for Palauan conservation. A bul , a moratorium on certain behaviors, can be used to let a tapped-out ecosystem rest. The local chief had requested details on why the place was special, but Golbuu was worried that the highly technical paper authored by Shamberger, the postdoc in Cohen\\'s lab, would need some explaining.\\n\\nFor the most part, Golbuu is waiting to hear back from the state legislature. \"What I told them is right now Nikko Bay is treated like any other Rock Island in Palau,\" he says. \"But it\\'s not. It\\'s very special. So all we are asking you is: try to treat it differently.\"\\n\\nThe legislature is dragging its feet, but the efforts to raise awareness have already helped, Golbuu thinks. A legislator checked with him after hearing a proposal to bring some sort of tourist submarine into Nikko Bay. Not here, Golbuu recommended, and the proposal was rejected.\\n\\nAs Barkley and I finish picking at the remnants of our dishes, I put the same question to her that preoccupies Golbuu. Just how heartened should we be about Palau\\'s special places? Can they last?\\n\\nBarkley brings up qualifiers. There\\'s the dump near Nikko Bay, which may not be properly sealed. There\\'s the sewage outflow. There are those tourists, she says, joking about them running the banana boat into the reefs. But if those threats can be contained and these corals protected, she says, \"they have probably the best chance of any of Palau\\'s reefs of surviving climate change.\"\\n\\nThe Palauan Way\\n\\nGolbuu feels intimately connected to the corals he wants to save. During his childhood, the village kids would cut through the mangroves, swim across Nikko Bay, and climb the hill to the Continental Hotel, the first high-class tourist hotel in Palau. \"So we\\'ll go up the dock, run up there, jump in their swimming pool and swim, and then they\\'ll chase us,\" Golbuu says with a chortle, reminiscing. Then they\\'d jump off the dock and swim back to the village.\\n\\nNow Golbuu is an ambassador for Palau to the international scientific and conservation communities. He\\'s full of pride for his country, its natural resources, and its people. Yes, saving the reef is an environmental issue, but he thinks Palauans, considering their traditional ways of life, are sufficiently motivated.\\n\\nFor them, the matter of saving their reefs goes beyond scientific literature and international conservation. They fish there. Palauan women gather sea cucumbers, and exchange carved sea turtle shells as IOUs. They benefit from ecotourism. They grind up coral rocks for building materials or use them to make chemical lime, which many Palauans add to betel nuts before chewing the blood-red mixture to get a mild high. \"Sometimes people forget why we\\'re doing this, and they think that this is for some other people. No, it\\'s for us,\" he says. \"This is our island. These are our fish.\" And corals and fish go hand in hand.\\n\\nIt\\'s a complex sort of stewardship Golbuu advocates, a flexible awareness of how resources are shared and how much can be taken. And yet it seems fundamentally Palauan. On a rainy day, I tag along with Golbuu\\'s employees Uly and Lincoln as they survey the corals and algae growing out on the barrier reef, north of Koror. At one site, while they\\'re in the water, our Palauan boat driver Ben and I huddle together under a small canopy to stay dry.\\n\\nBen was a fisherman for 12 years, but couldn\\'t take it anymore, he tells me. Catching fish to eat them doesn\\'t bother him; neither does giving a few to the neighbors in hopes of a good turn later. But he could no longer stomach selling the flesh. Now most days he drives dive boats for tourists.

(Reuters/Leah Millis)\\n\\nFifty-eight former high-ranking military and intelligence officials issued a stern warning to the White House: Think twice about creating a panel to counter the government\\'s own findings that climate change poses a threat to national security.\\n\\n\"Imposing a political test on reports issued by the science agencies, and forcing a blind spot onto the national security assessments that depend on them, will erode our national security,\" wrote a group of former generals, admirals and other national security officials in a letter Tuesday to President Trump, which I reported on here. \"It is dangerous to have national security analysis conform to politics.\"\\n\\nThey are objecting to plans by top administration officials to convene an ad hoc group of select federal scientists to scrutinize and potentially dispute the conclusions of recent federal climate reports, which The Post\\'s Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Brady Dennis revealed last week.\\n\\nOfficials are still determining what sort of group they will assemble to assess the government\\'s scientific findings and whether they will eventually establish an independent federal advisory committee to scrutinize climate science.\\n\\nYet the letter writers, who include heavyweights from President Barack Obama\\'s administration such as former secretary of state John F. Kerry and former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, already worry the panel will end up unduly \"second-guessing the scientific sources\" that underpin the grave conclusions from most military leaders that climate change is a menace to the nation\\'s security. They do not want the White House to, as they say, \"dispute and undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threat posed by climate change.\"\\n\\nThe question is whether there is any chance that Trump -- a commander in chief who likes to boast about \"my generals\" and \"my military\" -- will listen to these former military leaders.\\n\\n\"This letter is not an attack on the president, it is an offer of dialogue,\" said Andrew Holland, chief operating officer of the American Security Project. His group, along with the Center for Climate and Security, another policy and research nonprofit organization focused on security issues, organized the letter.\\n\\nIn various military and intelligence reports, military leaders predict that the impact of climate change will directly endanger U.S. facilities -- for example, a rise in sea level is expected to increase the risk of flooding at some naval bases. They also project that climate change will exacerbate conditions, such as drought, that lead to conflict.\\n\\nBut for years, Trump himself has had his mind made up: Climate change is \"madness,\" a \"con,\" a \"hoax.\" His administration has worked hard to unravel efforts under the previous president to curb climate-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants, natural gas wells and automobiles.\\n\\nStill, Holland said \"we do hold out hope\" of convincing Trump.\\n\\n\"We actively hope that he will listen to people like his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner,\" he said.\\n\\nThe couple, who both serve as senior White House advisers, each urged the president to keep the United States in the Paris climate accord, an international deal meant to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. But the president said early in his term the country would pull out of the widely hailed agreement.\\n\\nKerry helped broker that agreement for Obama. He, in particular, has made the urgency to curb global warming a focal point of his post-government career. In a recent Post op-ed denouncing Trump\\'s climate panel, Kerry called the administration\\'s efforts to \"paralyze\" U.S. climate action its \"most dangerous collision with facts.\"\\n\\nBut there is yet another goal to the letter, according to Holland: \"To offer clear support\" to career officers still working on climate and security issues within the federal bureaucracy.\\n\\nIn January, for instance, the national intelligence director delivered a worldwide threat assessment on \"climate hazards\" such as extreme weather and acidifying oceans, which threaten \"infrastructure, health, and water and food security.\"\\n\\nAnd in November, scientists from 13 federal agencies published a National Climate Assessment that concluded that \"the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country.\"\\n\\nIn an indication of where the White House panel is headed, Charles Kupperman, deputy national security adviser, said during the Situation Room meeting that Trump was upset that his administration had issued the National Climate Assessment at, The Post reported last week.\\n\\nRead more here:\\n\\n-- Half-a-dozen energy and environmental rollbacks championed by the Trump administration will, if enacted, generate an additional 209 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to a new report released Tuesday by NYU Law School\\'s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.\\n\\nThe analysis, which was unveiled by the attorneys general from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York, calculated the emissions associated with rules affecting the coal, automotive, oil and gas and solid waste industry. Most of the rules have been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. By 2025 these regulatory changes would spur greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to the annual output of nearly 54 coal-fired power plants, according to the report, or nearly 15 percent of the nation\\'s current fleet.\\n\\nMaryland Attorney Brian Frosh told reporters that President Trump vowed during the 2016 campaign that he would be \"a change agent. And unfortunately, he has. He has become an agent of climate change.\" \"He has targeted fossil fuels not to decrease their emissions or their threat to society, but to increase their emissions,\" Frosh said. The attorneys general said that they would continue to challenge the administration in court as they continued to rewrite the nation\\'s air and water policy. \"We will sue EPA at every change we get,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\\n\\nEPA spokeswoman Molly Block said the agency \"has not reviewed the report.\" The EPA has estimated its replacement of Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan -- one of the rules analyzed in the report -- could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1.5 percent by 2030 from projected levels.\\n\\n-- Juliet Eilperin\\n\\n-- McConnell vows Green New Deal will get vote soon: After telling reporters last week the resolution would get a vote in the Senate sometime before the August recess, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the chamber would vote on proposal in \"the next couple of weeks,\" Politico reports. Other Republicans continued a line of rhetorical attack on the plan, with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) penned a USA Today op-ed calling the Green New Deal \"unworkable and unaffordable.\" Politico reports, meanwhile, that Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) is putting himself in \"a leading role in his party\\'s resistance.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to keep at this\": Yet again, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized McConnell\\'s planned vote as a \"political stunt.\" On the Senate floor, Schumer referred to a climate resolution he\\'s announced, with backing from the entire Senate Democratic caucus, saying \"we\\'re not locking anyone in to this proposal or that proposal, we\\'re simply saying let\\'s start talking about it.\" He added: \"Actually... the one good thing about Leader McConnell\\'s stunt, we are talking about it.\"\\n\\n-- He\\'s not running: Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday he will not throw his hat into the already hat-filled ring for president. \"Advisers said he ultimately decided not to run after concluding he could accomplish more through his political activism and philanthropic work over the next two years, and by focusing on such issues as gun violence, opioid addiction and climate change,\" The Post\\'s Michael Scherer reports.\\n\\nWhat Bloomberg will do instead: \"Bloomberg plans to increase his investment in a philanthropic effort called Beyond Coal, which has worked to shutter coal-fired power plants in recent years, and to launch a new effort called Beyond Carbon, with the goal of largely eliminating the use of gas, oil and coal in the United States by 2050.\"\\n\\n-- \"It\\'s directly impacting our way of life\": During the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee\\'s first hearing of the year on climate change, Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski said addressing energy concerns amid global warming will be a \"priority for all of us.\" The Alaska Republican said the panel will prioritize efforts including \"keeping energy affordable and advancing cleaner technology that can help reduce greenhouse gases.\" She also lamented how climate change is impacting her home state of Alaska. \"In the Arctic we\\'re seeing warming at over twice the average of the rest of the Lower 48. It is directly impacting our way of life,\" the panel\\'s chair said. \"It\\'s diminishing sea ice and melting permafrost...It\\'s impacting subsistence. It\\'s impacting food security. It\\'s certainly impacting our economy with our fisheries.\"\\n\\nJoe Manchin III, the panel\\'s top Democrat from the coal-producing state of West Virginia, too said \"all communities, including those in energy-producing states like West Virginia and Alaska, are experiencing the harmful impacts of the climate crisis.\" He added that solution to that crisis must not put \"additional economic burdens\" on states like his already hurting from the downturn in coal.\\n\\n-- EPA blocked NASA plane from reviewing hurricane-ravaged Houston: Following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, NASA scientists wanted to fly a pollution-monitoring plane over the hurricane zone following the catastrophe that caused chemical spills and damaged industrial plants. But the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Texas stopped that from happening, the Los Angeles Times reports. The state\\'s director of toxicology Michael Honeycutt told NASA officials: \"At this time, we don\\'t think your data would be useful.\" EPA deferred to Honeycutt, and the \"response stunned NASA scientists, many of whom had flown similar missions in the past, including over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\\n\\n-- Lawmakers want answers on WWF after BuzzFeed report: Two lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the World Wide Fund for Nature, better known as WWF, following an extensive report from BuzzFeed News revealed it has equipped and helped fund \"paramilitary forces that have been accused of beating, torturing, sexually assaulting, and murdering scores of people.\" \"I strongly support efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, but this must not come at the cost of the health, safety, or life of innocent civilians,\" House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, according to BuzzFeed, while Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called for an \"immediate and thorough review\" of the United States\\' support of the charity.\\n\\n-- Ocean heat waves are happening more frequently: A new study found they\\'re happening more often than they did last century and it\\'s having a negative impact on marine life, the New York Times reports. The heat waves, which happen when sea temperatures are warmer than normal for at least five straight days, are damaging ocean ecosystems, including for kelp forests, sea grass beds and coral reefs. \"Scientists estimate that the oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by excess greenhouse gases since midcentury,\" the Times reports. \"This excess heat is increasing not only baseline ocean temperatures but also the frequency and duration of marine heat waves.\"\\n\\n-- Forbidding foam: Maryland is one step closer to becoming the first state to prohibit plastic foam cups and food containers after a bill to do gained final approval in the state Senate. It now moves on to be considered in the state House, The Post\\'s Ovetta Wiggins and Arelis R. Hernández report. Lawmakers in Hawaii are also considering a statewide ban and some cities, like New York, Miami and the District, already bar foam food and beverage containers. \"Support for the foam ban fell largely along partisan lines, with all Democrats backing it except Sen. Katherine A. Klausmeier (Baltimore County), who said she worried about the impact on small businesses,\" they write. \"Opponents of the bill said they were not certain it would help the environment as much as proponents claimed.\"\\n\\n-- Oil giants announce big plans for Permian output: In the coming years, oil giants Chevron and Exxon want to boost production in the \"heart of the American fracking boom,\" the Permian Basin, the Wall Street Journal reports. \"In the next five years, Chevron expects to more than double its production in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico to 900,000 barrels of oil and gas a day... That is a nearly 40% rise from its previous forecast,\" the Journal reports. \"Not to be outdone, Exxon on Tuesday announced plans to increase its Permian output to one million barrels of oil and gas a day by as early as 2024.\" The moves are the latest signal that major oil companies will drive future expansion of shale drilling.\\n\\n-- Here\\'s your next cold-weather activity: Next time the air turns frigid, try making frozen bubbles, The Post\\'s Matthew Cappucci suggests.', 'source': {'uri': 'washingtonpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Washington Post', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 6, 'alexaGlobalRank': 190, 'alexaCountryRank': 43}}, 'authors': [], 'links': ['https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/03/05/white-house-plans-counter-climate-change-will-erode-our-national-security-former-officials-warn/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/white-house-to-select-federal-scientists-to-reassess-government-climate-findings-sources-say/2019/02/24/49cd0a84-37dd-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html', 'https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/12/trump-climate-timeline/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/19/top-trump-advisors-at-odds-over-paris-climate-deal/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-kerry-disband-your-climate-denial-panel-mr-president/2019/02/25/002f6b0e-3924-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/11/23/major-trump-administration-climate-report-says-damages-are-intensifying-across-country/', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/white-house-to-select-federal-scientists-to-reassess-government-climate-findings-sources-say/2019/02/24/49cd0a84-37dd-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/03/05/white-house-plans-counter-climate-change-will-erode-our-national-security-former-officials-warn/', 'https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/energy202?method=SURL&location=ENL', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/mcconnell-green-new-deal-1205439', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/03/04/green-new-deal-unworkable-unaffordable-john-barrasso-editorials-debates/3060139002/', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/rob-bishopclimate-agenda-1236056', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?458442-1/senate-session&start=2301', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-new-york-mayor-michael-bloomberg-bows-out-of-2020-democratic-presidential-contest/2019/03/05/103826d2-3f62-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAaQd8yeP_w&feature=youtu.be', 'https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-nasa-jet-epa-hurricane-harvey-20190305-story.html', 'https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/senior-us-lawmakers-call-for-urgent-review-of-wwf-funding', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/climate/marine-heat-waves.html?action=click&module=Discovery&pgtype=Homepage', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/as-general-assembly-pace-picks-up-democrats-vow-1b-more-for-schools-over-two-years/2019/03/05/d74d7b74-3f4d-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html?utm_term=.54ce43a9568d'], 'image': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/2abc89b974cf4875c99cd035ba51b011-3500-2334-70-8-CUHNSQB7RYI6TIGTCIIOLCUUZ4.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517', 'eventUri': 'eng-4636551', 'shares': {'facebook': 105}, 'sentiment': -0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 6}\n",

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.]\\n\\nThis excess heat is increasing not only baseline ocean temperatures but also the frequency and duration of marine heat waves.\\n\\nAn earlier study by some of the same researchers found that, from 1925 to 2016, marine heat waves became, on average, 34 percent more frequent and 17 percent longer. Over all, there were 54 percent more days per year with marine heat waves globally.\\n\\nThe most severe years tended to be El Niño years. Warmer ocean temperatures are one of the characteristics of an El Niño pattern.\\n\\n\"There\\'s also some indication that El Niños have been getting more extreme with climate change,\" said Eric C. J. Oliver, an assistant professor of physical oceanography at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who was a co-author of the study. But regional marine heat waves can happen even without an El Niño, he said.\\n\\nAs ocean heat waves proliferate, problems will mount for people who depend on fishing and fish farming, or aquaculture, said Gretchen Hofmann, chairwoman of the department of ecology, evolution and marine biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\\n\\n\"If you look at geography, lots of the world\\'s population lives on the coast,\" said Dr. Hofmann, who was not involved in the study. \"Commercial fisheries, but also aquaculture facilities on the coast, will face challenges as ocean water changes. Heat waves are not great for aquaculture production.\"\\n\\nThe study\\'s authors found many parts of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans where aquatic life was especially vulnerable. These areas were home to a lot of biological diversity and had plants and animals that were already living in the warmer parts of their ranges. They were also affected by other human impacts like pollution and overfishing.\\n\\nEven seabirds did not emerge from marine heat waves unscathed, most likely because their food sources either died off or moved in response to the warming.\\n\\nBut perhaps the biggest surprise was the significant loss of what biologists call foundational species, like coral reefs, sea grasses and kelp forests. They support the diversity of aquatic life by providing shelter from predators, moderating temperatures and acting as food sources. When they disappear, the entire ecosystem disappears along with them.\\n\\nClimate change \"may be a gradual process, but set on that backdrop are these extreme warming events that might be becoming more common that can have more dramatic consequences,\" said Robert Miller, an associate research biologist at the Marine Science Institute of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.\\n\\n\"In some cases ecosystems might not be able to recover from those events,\" he said. \"And so, the effects of climate change might happen a lot sooner than we expect.\"\\n\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.', 'source': {'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 1, 'alexaGlobalRank': 100, 'alexaCountryRank': 30}}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'kendra_pierre_louis@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Kendra Pierre-Louis', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'links': ['https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/climate/record-heat-waves.html?module=inline', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0412-1', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116000057?via%3Dihub', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/12/science/earth/ocean-warming-climate-change.html?module=inline', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/12/science/earth/ocean-warming-climate-change.html?module=inline', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03732-9', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/fish-climate-change.html?module=inline'], 'image': 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/02/climate/marine-heatwave-map-1551663366872/marine-heatwave-map-1551663366872-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-4639068', 'shares': {'facebook': 2383, 'pinterest': 14}, 'sentiment': -0.05882352941176472, 'wgt': 6}\n",

Salts lower the freezing point of water, allowing water molecules to stay liquid.\\n\\nThis is pretty reasonable. \"There is salt present all over Mars,\" Kirsten Siebach, a Mars geologist and assistant professor in the Rice University Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, noted in an interview.\\n\\nBut in the new study published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Bramson and her team found that even ample amounts of salt wouldn\\'t do the trick. \"Salts alone are not enough to explain the liquid water,\" said Bramson. There needed to be heat, and one of the most plausible ideas is that Mars itself provided the internal furnace.\\n\\nThis raises a question of continued scientific intrigue: Is Mars -- an outwardly long-dead planet -- geologically alive? This is no small matter. It would mean there\\'s magma (underground lava) moving around certain portions of its interior, and possibly sustaining other bodies of water.\\n\\n\"It would be unlikely, but not impossible,\" said Siebach, who had no role in the study.\\n\\n\"There is potential for Mars to be active in that way in some locations,\" Siebach added.\\n\\nBut in this instance, the hot rock would need to ooze up in the vicinity of this ice sheet. The odds of all this happening aren\\'t too high.\\n\\n\"A lot of conditions would have to be just right for there to be liquid water,\" said Siebach.\\n\\nBut if Mars does have heat -- or remnants of geologically recent heat some four or five miles beneath its surface -- planetary scientists will have a much clearer idea soon enough. In November, NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft safely landed on Mars. The Martian probe will study the planet\\'s interior and ultimately answer the looming extraterrestrial quandary: Is Mars alive or dead?\\n\\n\"That\\'s a big motivation for InSight,\" said Bramson.\\n\\n\"The question of present-day heat flow provides a window into not only current processes, but also Mars\\' earliest history,\" Sue Smrekar, NASA\\'s deputy principal investigator for InSight, added over email.\\n\\nTo answer the question, InSight will bore a hole nearly 16 feet into the Martian ground to probe the planet\\'s temperature. It will measure heat at distances of up to 1,500 miles away, in locations that are suspected to have experienced volcanism within the last 10 million years, Smrekar said.\\n\\nWhile Mars may have been volcanically active a few hundreds thousand years ago, there is no direct, compelling evidence of such underground volcanism today. Between 2011 and 2014, scientists used sophisticated telescopes to detect volcanic gases leaking from different locations on the Martian surface. They found little of these telltale gases in the atmosphere.\\n\\n\"The resulting absence of such atmospheric gases ruled out the presence of major outgassing on current-day Mars,\" Alain Khayat, a postdoctoral research associate at the Planetary Systems Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of that report, said over email.\\n\\nBut, Khayat noted that Mars is home to long-lived volcanoes like Olympus Mons -- the largest volcano in the solar system -- which was likely active for two or three billion years. This long, rich volcanic history increases the odds of finding chambers of hot magma under the ground that could have melted ice beneath the Martian south pole, he said.\\n\\nPerhaps, then Mars was still alive in geologically recent time, and potentially even today, too.\\n\\n\"The one thing we can guarantee when we send a new mission to Mars is we will be surprised,\" said Siebach.', 'source': {'uri': 'mashable.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mashable', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 13, 'alexaGlobalRank': 1391, 'alexaCountryRank': 411}}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'mark_kaufman@mashable.com', 'name': 'Mark Kaufman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'links': ['https://mashable.com/article/mars-underground-water-life/', 'https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL080985', 'http://mashable.com/article/opportunity-rover-mars-last-picture?utm_cid=a-seealso', 'https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-insight-landing/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103517300301', 'https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/olympus-mons.html', 'https://mashable.com/video/katie-mack-theoretical-astrophysicist-cosmology?utm_cid=a-bonusvideo'], 'image': 'https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F91444%252Fb97cd8ba-0eaa-472f-87f9-d3d8e57021a0.jpg%252F640x360.jpg?signature=Rx9uEZoMIvbyu4kenkmBlnQ-O2Y=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com', 'eventUri': 'eng-4596723', 'shares': {'facebook': 10}, 'sentiment': -0.003921568627450966, 'wgt': 6}\n",

But the third-order draft of the Global Change Research Program Climate Science Special Report only garnered mainstream attention after The New York Times published it inside an article Monday.\\n\\nThe National Academy of Sciences has already endorsed the draft report, but many scientists -- including some of the paper\\'s authors -- have expressed concern that Trump officials might rewrite or suppress the findings.\\n\\nTrump once famously called climate change a Chinese \"hoax,\" and he\\'s filled his administration with several other skeptics, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\\n\\nDespite this report (and piles of evidence from previously published studies), Trump administration officials have continued to push a narrative that claims scientists are unsure whether human activity has significantly increased the rate of global warming in recent years.\\n\\nHere are six statements the Trump team has made about climate change that have no basis in reality, as evidenced by the federal climate science report:\\n\\n\"I\\'m not a believer in man-made global warming. It could be warming, and it\\'s going to start to cool at some point.\" (September 2015)\\n\\nWhat the science actually shows: The science is clear that man-made global warming is not only real, but also one of the greatest threats that humanity faces.\\n\\nPeople have released so much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere that the planet will continue to warm for at least the next 100 years -- even if carbon emissions caused by human activity immediately cease.\\n\\nFrom the federal report:\\n\\nThe last few years have also seen record-breaking, climate-related, weather extremes, as well as the warmest years on record for the globe. ...\\n\\nGlobal climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. Even if humans immediately ceased emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, existing levels would commit the world to at least an additional 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit over this century relative to today. ...\\n\\nThe magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat trapping) gases emitted globally and the sensitivity of Earth\\'s climate to those emissions. ...\\n\\nLonger-term climate records indicate that average temperatures in recent decades over much of the world have been much higher than at any time in the past 1700 years or more.\\n\\nTrump again:\\n\\n\"Record low temperatures and massive amounts of snow. Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING?\" (February 2015)\\n\\nWhat the science actually shows: There may be some outlier days, but overall, climate change has caused extremely cold days to become warmer and it\\'s increased the frequency of \"extreme heat events,\" according to the latest report.\\n\\nAlso, research has consistently debunked the claim that \"massive amounts of snow\" suggest global warming isn\\'t occurring. In fact, heavier precipitation is the result of evaporating ocean water caused by global warming, the research shows. This phenomena could explain \"snowmageddon\"-type extreme snow events.\\n\\nFrom the report:\\n\\nExtremely cold days have become warmer since the early 1900s, and extremely warm days have become warmer since the early 1960s. In recent decades, extreme cold waves have become less common while extreme heat waves have become more common. ...\\n\\nThe frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation and extreme heat events are increasing in most regions of the world. These trends are consistent with expected physical responses to a warming climate and with climate model studies, although models tend to underestimate the observed trends. The frequency and intensity of such extreme events will very likely continue to rise in the future. ...\\n\\nThe increase in extreme weather that accompany global climate change are having significant, direct effects on the United States and the global economy and society.\\n\\n\"Measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do. And there\\'s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it\\'s a primary contributor to the climate change.\" (March 2017)\\n\\nWhat the science actually shows: There\\'s virtually zero disagreement among federal climate scientists that human activity is not only a factor, but also the \"dominant cause\" driving the relatively recent and dramatic acceleration of global warming. This finding is repeated throughout the report.\\n\\nFrom the report:\\n\\nHuman activities are now the dominant cause of the observed changes in climate. ...\\n\\nThe global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of the natural changes in climate that have occurred throughout Earth\\'s history. ...\\n\\nMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era. There are no alternative explanations, and no natural cycles are found in the observational record that can explain the observed changes in climate.\\n\\nGlaciers in Montana started melting \"right after the end of the Ice Age\" and it\\'s been \"a consistent melt.\" (June 2017)\\n\\nWhat the science actually shows: Scientists have already debunked Zinke\\'s claim that Glacier National Park\\'s namesake feature has been melting consistently since \"right after the end of the Ice Age.\" Glaciers have generally retreated since about 1850, the end of the Little Ice Age, but global warming has caused the rate of retreat to increase in recent decades.\\n\\nThe draft report further suggests that man-made global warming is accelerating the melting of mountain glaciers, snow cover and sea ice worldwide.\\n\\nFrom the report:\\n\\nObservations continue to show that Arctic sea ice extent and thickness, Northern Hemisphere snow cover, and the volume of mountain glaciers and continental ice sheets are all decreasing. In many cases, evidence suggests that the net loss of mass from the global cryosphere is accelerating. ...\\n\\nThe annually averaged ice mass from global reference glaciers has decreased every year since 1984, and the rate of global glacier melt is accelerating. This mountain glacier melt is contributing to sea level rise and will continue to contribute through the 21st Century.\\n\\nZinke again:\\n\\n\"The evidence strongly suggests that humans have had an influence on higher CO2. However, the evidence is equally as strong that there are other factors, such as rising ocean temperatures, that have a greater influence.\" (August 2014)\\n\\nWhat the science actually suggests: As we should all know by now, carbon emissions released by human activity are the \"dominant cause\" of accelerated global warming. Ocean temperatures are rising, but that\\'s because humans are emitting more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\n\\nFrom the report:\\n\\nThe world\\'s oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat caused by greenhouse warming since the mid 20th Century, making them warmer and altering global and regional circulation patterns and climate feedbacks. Surface oceans have warmed by about 0.45°F (0.25°C) globally since the 1970s. ...\\n\\nThe world\\'s oceans are currently absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually from human activities, making them more acidic with potential detrimental impacts to marine ecosystems. The rate of acidification is unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years.\\n\\n\"Most likely the primary control knob [for the temperature of the Earth and for climate] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.\" (June 2017)\\n\\nWhat the science actually shows: Like Zinke, Perry downplayed humans\\' role in global warming and blamed \"ocean waters\" instead. Perry also appeared to suggest that the environment is responsible for changes in the environment, which is somewhat challenging to make sense of.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible he was referring to previously natural variability, such as El Niño and La Niña, though the draft report found such phenomena have \"limited influences\" on long-term climate change. Some studies have suggested man-made global warming may \"greatly increase the frequency of very strong\" El Niño or La Niña events.\\n\\nFrom the report:', 'source': {'uri': 'huffingtonpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Huffington Post', 'ranking': {'importanceRank': 4, 'alexaGlobalRank': 269, 'alexaCountryRank': 83}}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'hayley_miller@huffingtonpost.com', 'name': 'Hayley Miller', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'links': ['https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914641/Draft-of-the-Climate-Science-Special-Report.pdf', 'https://archive.org/about/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/climate/climate-change-drastic-warming-trump.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=2', 'http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/us-climate-change-report-donald-trump-denier-suppress-global-warming-china-hoax-average-temperature-a7882856.html', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-donald-trump-climate-change-hoax_us_582ceb8be4b099512f80d55e', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrpSzEPx7I', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-climate-change-hoax_us_587f9ecfe4b0cf0ae88131b6', 'http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-climate-change-presidential-politics-20160526-snap-story.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/nasa-climate-change-warning-earth-temperature-warming', 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earthtalks-global-warming-harsher-winter/', 'http://uk.businessinsider.com/cold-weather-doesnt-discredit-climate-change-2014-11?r=US&IR=T', 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160127-will-snow-become-a-thing-of-the-past-as-the-climate-warms', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-carbon-dioxide_us_58c16401e4b0d1078ca48714', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-franken-ryan-zinke_us_59495d35e4b07d3e35d8b783', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-franken-ryan-zinke_us_59495d35e4b07d3e35d8b783', 'http://missoulian.com/news/local/montana-s-u-s-house-candidates-energy-plans-reveal-contrasts/article_cd64dbb4-1b69-11e4-8c74-0019bb2963f4.html', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-perry-climate-change-trump_us_5952b08ee4b05c37bb7a0e6b', 'http://climatechange.cornell.edu/whats-el-nino-up-to-now/', 'https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914641/Draft-of-the-Climate-Science-Special-Report.pdf', 'https://app.appsflyer.com/%7B%7Bid%7D%7D?pid=Acquisition&c=US_Internal_YMktg_HuffPostMobileWebBP_House_Users&af_sub1=Internal&af_sub2=US_YMktg_US_YMktg&af_sub3=Mid_Evergreen_v2'], 'image': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b55f222000044001a536b.jpeg?cache=yuwkpbt3xi&ops=1910_1000', 'eventUri': 'eng-4595810', 'shares': {}, 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 6}\n",
